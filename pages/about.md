My name is PJ King, and I hail from Waco, Texas. I am a senior software engineer simultaneously pursuing pulpit supply, interim ministry, and itinerant ministry. Above, you will find a menu with links to my current [résumé]({{site.url}}/cv/). Feel free to connect with me concerning either software or ministry via [email](mailto:{{site.owner.email}}), [twitter](http://twitter.com/{{site.owner.twitter}}/), or [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/{{site.owner.facebook}}/).

I was born and raised in Waco, Texas and have lived in 14 homes, six cities, three states, and two countries since leaving home to earn my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu/).  I recently completed my Master of Divinity in Christian Ministry at [Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary](http://www.sebts.edu/).

My wonderful bride, Kathryn King, and I currently have four children: Vernon, Brooklyn, Emma, and Seth. Katie faithfully updates family, friends and strangers about our brood at her blog, [Adopted by the King](http://www.adoptedbytheking.com/). 

Please take a look around, and again, contact me with any questions you may have.
