My name is Vernon King, and I am privileged to have a background in both software development and pastoral ministry. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu/) and a Master of Divinity in Christian Ministry at [Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary](http://www.sebts.edu/). 

I am available for itinerant preaching, intentional interims, and church consultation. Feel free to review my [résumé]({{site.url}}/cv/) and contact me for any of your ministerial needs. You may reach me via [email](mailto:{{site.owner.email}}), [twitter](http://twitter.com/{{site.owner.twitter}}/), or [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/{{site.owner.facebook}}/).

If you are interested in my software background, please visit my [companion site](http://www.pjking.org/).

I was born and raised in Waco, Texas,  but have since lived in 14 homes, six cities, three states, and two countries before needing to return to my hometown in order to best care for my family. I am happily employed as a software engineer, working remotely from my home in Waco.

My wonderful bride, Kathryn King, and I currently have four children: Vernon, Brooklyn, Emma, and Seth. Katie faithfully updates family, friends and strangers about our brood at her blog, [Adopted by the King](http://www.adoptedbytheking.com/). 

Please take a look around, and again, contact me with any questions you may have.
