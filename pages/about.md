Welcome to my personal website. Above, you will find a menu with links to my pastoral and theological writings in addition to my current [CV]({{site.url}}/cv/). You can browse all of my articles in the [archives]({{site.url}}/archives/) section. Furthermore, feel free to connect with me via [email](mailto:{{site.owner.email}}), [twitter](http://twitter.com/{{site.owner.twitter}}/), or [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/{{site.owner.facebook}}/).

I was born and raised in Waco, Texas but have lived in 13 homes, six cities, three states, and two countries since leaving home to earn my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu/). Although I am a vocational software developer, I am a pastor at heart. I am currently pursuing my Master of Divinity in Christian Ministry at [Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary](http://www.sebts.edu/) and hope to transition into a pastoral role in the near future.

My wonderful bride, Kathryn King, and I currently have four children: Vernon, Brooklyn, Emma, and Seth. Katie faithfully updates family, friends and strangers about our brood at her blog, [Adopted by the King](http://www.adoptedbytheking.com/). I pray her writing will bless you as it has blessed me and many readers over the years.

Take a look around; I hope you enjoy what you discover.
