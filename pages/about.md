Welcome to my personal website. Take a look around; I hope you enjoy what you discover. Above, you will find links to my pastoral and theological writings, in addition to my current CV. To browse all of my articles, go to the [archives]({{site.url}}/archives) section. As you may note, my posts have no comments section, but I still want to hear from you all. Below, you can find out how to connect with me via email, twitter, or facebook.

For those of you finding me for the first time, my name is Vernon R. King, III. I was born and bred in Waco, Texas and will always be a Texan, despite having lived in six cities, three states, and two countries since beginning college at Texas A&M University. Vocationally, I am a software developer, but I am a pastor at heart. I am currently pursuing my Master of Divinity in Christian Ministry at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary and hope to transition into a pastoral role in the near future.

My wonderful bride is Kathryn King and we currently have four children: Vernon, Brooklyn, Emma, and Seth. Katie faithfully updates family, friends and strangers about our little family at [Adopted by the King](http://www.adoptedbytheking.com). I pray her writing will bless you as it has blessed many others over the years.
