Having felt an earnest call to ministry since college, I have been preparing for both foreign missions and domestic church ministry through internship opportunities, academic study, voracious reading, intense dialog, and a foray into electronic publishing. While my primary focus has been church health, including church planting and church strengthening, I have been gifted in personal counseling and have experience in adoption ministry. I hope to transition into ministry prior to or upon graduation. 

I affirm the [Abstract of Principles](http://www.founders.org/abstract.html), the [Baptist Faith and Message 2000](http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp), the [Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy](http://library.dts.edu/Pages/TL/Special/ICBI_1.pdf), and the [Danvers Statement on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood](http://cbmw.org/uncategorized/the-danvers-statement/).
