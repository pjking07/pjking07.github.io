Having felt an earnest call to ministry since college, I have been preparing for both foreign missions and domestic church ministry through internship opportunities, academic study, voracious reading, intense dialog, and a foray into electronic publishing. While my primary focus has been church health, including church planting and church strengthening, I have been gifted in personal counseling and have experience in adoption ministry. I hope to transition into ministry prior to or upon graduation. 

I affirm the [Abstract of Principles](), the [Baptist Faith and Message 2000](), the [Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy](), and the [Danvers Statement on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood]().
