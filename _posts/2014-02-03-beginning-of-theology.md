The starting place of Christian theology can be located within its name. Christian theology is "Christian" because it is theology done by Christians; its starting point is Christian faith itself. Done rightly, Christian theology reflects the truths of the faith of Christianity, but the starting point of Christian theology must be belief in the Christian gospel.

If one does not start with Christian faith, theological study and thought will lead one into a theology that is decidedly unChristian, for Christian theology is the pursuit of knowing God by his Word, within a community of believers. Without faith in the Christian God, one may learn facts about God, but this is not "Christian". In order to be a Christian, one must have faith in the person and work Jesus Christ, the Son of God. In order to be a Christian theologian, one must be a Christian, seeking to know God more and to know more about God. Therefore, the act of Christian theology begins with faith in the God who is the subject of this theology. Only by faith and the aid of the Holy Spirit may one know God, interpret Scripture rightly, fully participate in the fellowship of the church, and thus participate in Christian theology. 

Satan himself has a theology about the Christian God, but he is obviously not participating in Christian theology. Whereas demons know the content of Scripture, the Christian theologian seeks knowledge of the God of Scripture. Whereas Satan manipulates Scripture to suit his own ends, the Christian theologian interprets Scripture for the good of the Church. Even if Satan and his companions know that God is Trinity, a central tenet of the faith, they are still not participating in Christian theology because, rather than accepting God as he is, they have rejected his authority and placed themselves over him in their own minds. Satan and his minions take the Christian Scripture and twist it; they take the Christian God and reject his authority; they replace faith in God with faith in themselves. Despite such familiarity with all aspects of Christianity, clearly, such creatures are not participating in Christian theology!

From that extreme example, one might better understand the necessity of faith on the part of the Christian theologian. Because Christian theology is the pursuit of knowing God, one who does not have faith in God is simply not participating in Christian theology. Anyone seeking knowledge of the Christian God, without having (or receiving) faith in the Christian God, will come to an end that is not Christian, because he is not rooted in Christian faith. Christian theology is theology done by Christians, therefore, one must be a Christian in order to participate. What makes one a Christian? Simply, one must have faith in the risen Lord Jesus, who is the Son of God, one person of the Trinity, co-equal with the Father and Spirit. Out of such faith, the Christian does the good works which God prepared in advance (Eph. 2:10), including the good work of obeying the commands of Jesus (John 15:10). One of the good works set before the Christian is to better know the God in whom he has faith, i.e., the task of Christian theology. 

The end of Christian theology is knowing God; the beginning of Christian theology is faith in him. Such faith is a gift from God himself, so that no man may boast in his works (Eph. 2:8)---especially his work of Christian theology! Rather, Christian theology is an outflow of our faith, for our benefit, so that we may know God more and become more like him. Praise be to God!
