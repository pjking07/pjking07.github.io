Jesus has given pastors to the church in order "to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God" (Eph. 4:12--13). Therefore, a pastor's work must be oriented around equipping Christians for ministry. Similarly, in his first epistle to Timothy, Paul instructs his disciple in how to "be a good servant of Christ Jesus" for the sake of the church (1 Tim. 4:6--16).[^esv] Although Timothy was not strictly an elder at the church in Ephesus, Paul's instructions to his apostolic delegate reinforce this foundation for pastoral ministry.

[^esv]: Unless otherwise specified, all Scripture references are from the English Standard Version (ESV).

Paul exhorts Timothy to train himself "in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine" and "for godliness" (1 Tim. 4:6--7). In the same way, the pastor must first give attention to himself and his spiritual state. He must prepare himself for the work of Christian ministry by knowing the Christian God and Christian doctrine. Without such personal preparation, the pastor is sure to fail; he cannot equip the saints without first being equipped himself. Therefore, a pastor must continually train himself in knowledge and application of the Scripture, and in his activity in the prayer closet so that he may know God and be known by God. Paul concludes the aforementioned passage by instructing Timothy to "keep a close watch" on himself (1 Tim. 4:16). Again, the pastor who keeps vigilant watch over his own godliness and doctrine builds a strong framework for his own ministry.

Next, Paul commands Timothy to teach the church. Specifically, Timothy was to teach from the Scripture and through his own exemplary life (1 Tim. 4:12--15). In the same way, a pastor must devote himself to teaching his congregation through the pages of the Bible and his personal example.

A pastor is responsible for both teaching the Scripture to the church and for exhorting the church to follow scriptural tenets. While expository preaching may be a pastor's primary method of scriptural instruction, the pastor(s) of a church must also work to make the entire church Word-driven. The Word ought to drive each aspect of the church service---preaching, singing, praying, order, content, and ordinances. Furthermore, the Word must determine the structure of polity, "Sunday School", small groups, discipling, pastoral relationships, benevolence ministry, and the life of the home. Therefore, a pastor's teaching of Scripture may begin with, but must not end with, expository preaching. Moreover, Paul commands Timothy to keep a close watch "on the teaching". In the same way, pastors ought to oversee others' teaching in the church to ensure it aligns with Scripture. Without such pastoral oversight, wolves can enter the church and lead the sheep astray.

As for the pastor's personal example, Paul instructs Timothy to "set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity" (1 Tim. 4:12). In this way, a church can follow Jesus by closely following the model of the pastor's life (cf. 1 Cor. 11:1). A pastor will either substantiate or invalidate his teaching of the Scripture through his everyday behavior, so his life-pattern ought to be an ongoing application of the Scripture for his flock. Along with the rest of the body of Christ, the pastor should "rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep" (Rom. 12:15). He must be "hospitable" to others (1 Tim. 3:2). He is called to excel in all the one-anothers of the Christian community, for the sheep must know their shepherds and the shepherds, their sheep if the church is going to learn the Scripture well.

A good servant of Christ Jesus will train himself, teach the church, and live an exemplary life. These are the most important aspects of pastoral ministry as well. Each task contributes to the pastor's work of equipping the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ. Churches everywhere will reap gospel benefits if they give opportunity for their pastors to focus most on these three themes.
