In Genesis 2:7, we find that "the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature." To one unfamiliar with the Christian creation narrative, it might see odd that we claim the first man was created out of dust. Odd though it may seem to the uninitiated, Adam's beginning from the dust of the earth is significant for Christian theology and for us and our salvation. 

As one created from the dust, Adam was a special, new creation; Adam had no physical father. No creature begat Adam. Adam is not descended from any primate or "pre-human". Indeed, God made Adam from the dust in order to distinguish him from the other animals. Because of this special creation, we know that all humans are descended from the one man Adam. Our common descent from Adam is theologically significant for establishing the effect of original sin and for laying a foundation for the Son of God to become the second Adam.

As the father of humanity, Adam bore an inherent responsibility toward all of his progeny. However, through the deception of the serpent and the temptation of his heart, Adam sinned, brought about the fall, and radically altered mankind's relationship with God for all generations. Because we are all children of Adam, we inherit the broken relationship between God and us as a result of sin and the fall. By Adam, we are born into a fallen world, separated from God. However, if Adam were not the universal father of mankind, then his original sin would not affect each and every human; those who happened to be descended from someone other than Adam would lie in a different spiritual state.

The Son of God became man, took on flesh, and became a son of Adam. As Luke emphasizes, Jesus' human lineage begins with the first man, Adam. Jesus was born as a son of Adam so that he could be the second Adam. All humans share in the life, sin, and death of Adam, but the Son came so that we might share in the life, death, resurrection, and perfection of Jesus. As the second Adam, Jesus came to remedy all the sin, pain, suffering, and death that the first Adam caused. However, if Adam was not made from dust and was not the father of all humanity, then Jesus, as the second Adam, would necessarily be unable to save those who were not descendants of Adam. The work of the second Adam is only effective for the descendants of the first Adam---this must include all of humanity in order for Jesus' work to be accessible by all mankind.

As Adam was made from the dust, all humans die and return to dust. Without the second Adam, this would be the end of our bodies. Perhaps our spirits would move on to a place of peace or a place of torment, but our persons would be eternally incomplete, missing our physical bodies. However, because the resurrection of Christ applies to all descendants of Adam, every man's spirit will be reunited with his reconstituted, heavenly body at the final resurrection. Some bodies will be raised to new life, others will be raised to eternal destruction, but all will be raised as complete persons---body and spirit.

Adam was made from dust so that he alone could be the human father of mankind. Though Adam fathered us into a broken relationship with God, Jesus came as the second Adam to reconcile men to God. Only by the universal fatherhood of Adam can we share in the brotherhood of Christ and be reconciled with our heavenly Father.
