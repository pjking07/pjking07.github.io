This morning Jim Stitzinger of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary gave a brief talk on the significance of dying to self and dying with Christ for the sake of the mission. Subsequently, Alvin Reid of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary found seven principles for ministry in Acts 11:19--30: (1) see God working, (2) choose joy, (3) be an encourager, (4) have Spirit-empowered integrity, (5) share Christ, (6) invest in others, and (7) see God move through you.

Later this morning, Dan Hyun, planter of Village Church Baltimore, who spoke on the multi-cultural identity of his church. Most significantly, Hyun established that multi-*cultural* is broader than multi-*ethnic*; people of the same race but different socio-economic strata usually do not get along. Hyun said, "Multi-cultural is mixing people who've been to jail with people who are *afraid of* people who've been to jail."

Tonight we had a change-up. Along with many others, I went to a Baltimore Oriole's game. Many weeks ago, we had the opportunity to sign up to attend different activities tonight. At that time, we didn't know what church we would be working with or what their schedule might be. Unfortunately, this resulted in the game conflicting with the neighborhood party my team had been advertising all week. Half of the team was still free to go to the party, while most others went to the game, and some went to another church's "coffee shop" event. 

Arranged through a friend, I rode to the game with three other SEBTS students I had never metâ€”not even this week. I continue to be floored by how many students we have at Crossover Baltimore this year. Notably, Southeastern President Danny Akin sat in the midst of the SEBTS block of seats and he was an absolute riot! 

The Orioles played the Athletics. After a slow start, the Oriole's maintained a lead until the eighth inning. The Athletics tied it up and the game did not finish until the bottom of the 11th, with the opposing team winning by 1.

Pray for all of us and our churches tomorrow. The big event of Crossover Baltimore is Saturday when all the SBC churches involved are hosting events in parks and churches in order to reach out to the city and win them for Christ.
