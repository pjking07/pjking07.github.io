Christian theology is a culturally appropriate retelling of the gospel of Jesus Christ according to the Scriptures. The task of Christian theology begins with faith in the gospel message because only Christians are able to participate in Christian theology. The starting point of Christian theology is credobaptism, which is a summary statement of the gospel: we have died, been buried, and raised again with Jesus in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The source of Christian theology is the Bible and the end of Christian theology is our own spiritual formation. Finally, the fruit of Christian theology is doctrine.

Christian theology involves retelling, not repeating, the story of the Bible. We want to take the story of Scripture and retell it in a holistic, systematic way so that we maintain the original meaning. Our methodology for Christian theology includes (1) beginning with faith represented in baptism, (2) using Scripture as source, (3) communicating with the community of faith, (4) resynthesizing a communicable message, and (5) reflecting again in light of our discussion.

We begin with the faith expressed in baptism because Christian theology is a community activity. If you do not belong to the community, then you cannot properly participate in the practice of Christian theology. We turn to baptism as a summary statement because, for credobaptists, it is a necessary expression and affirmation of our faith. At baptism, we summarize the entirety of the Bible as commanded in the Great Commission. Furthermore, we identify ourselves in Christ and with Christ's people, the church. We also confess the faith passed to the saints and attest to our own participation in that faith. Through the baptismal formulation, we also confess the Trinity: Father, Son, and Spirit. In Christian Theology, we start with the faith expressed in baptism because it symbolizes the entire faith in which we profess to participate.

From the summary of our baptism, we move to the grand narrative of Scripture. We want to read and understand all 66 parts of the biblical canon. Because we affirm Scripture to be the revelation of God, we want to look to the details of that revelation to explain the faith we express in baptism. Also, because we have been baptized, we already understand the overall meaning of the Scripture: it is the story of God working through Christ to reconcile the world to himself. Therefore, we read Scripture to hear God speak his self-revelation to us. 

Using the Scripture as source, we participate in our community of faith through discussion (theologizing) about God via the source of the Bible. While this dialogue is an opportunity to speak, it is primarily an opportunity to listen to other believers, for we will not properly parse and process all of the Scripture on our own. The voices we listen to in this dialogue are pilgrims on the same journey as we are, co-laboring in the retelling of the gospel story in a culturally appropriate way. Furthermore, this community spans geography and time. Inasmuch as we are able, we should listen to Christians from past eras and across the world. By discussing theology with those in different cultural contexts, we are better able to see what blinds us in our own culture. 

Within this dialogue, we learn how to articulate what we believe in a culturally appropriate manner, therein communicating rightly. This message is synthesized into doctrinal statements (the fruit of our theology) so that we can further discuss its merits and accuracy. Furthermore, as we converse outside of our culture, we learn how to communicate these doctrines in more culturally appropriate ways. 

As we dialogue with other believers, we better understand what the Scripture teaches and where are own understanding might be lacking. Therefore, our final step in the theological cycle is to reflect again on the text, summary, and explanations of Scripture to continue on the path of right interpretation. We must reflect on our articulation and consider whether it truly fits the story of Scripture. We must understand the fallibility of our own interpretation and always be open to being schooled by the Scriptures, by the enlightenment of the Spirit, and through the community of faith.
