# Introduction

The violent conquest of Canaan can be an interpretive concern for the Christian. The level of violence prescribed and described in the conquests seems to run against Christian sensibility and meekness. Indeed, when approaching these texts, one might question God’s moral culpability in prescribing the destruction of Canaan and Israel’s moral integrity in obeying God’s command. However, by account of Scripture, those who reject God merit his wrath and punishment by the instrument of his choosing.

# Extent of the Violence

God prescribed to Israel two types of conquest: (1) devoting the enemy to destruction and (2) enjoying the spoil of the enemy. Deuteronomy 20:16–17 describes devoting the enemy to destruction: “But in the cities of these peoples that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes, but you shall devote them to complete destruction.”[^E-1] While devoting the enemy to destruction requires the death of all humans and animals, enjoying the spoil of the enemy is significantly different. As prescribed in Deuteronomy 20:10–15, the enemy outside of Canaan was to receive an offer of peace through forced labor. If the enemy responded with violence, then the LORD commanded Israel to “put all its males to the sword, but the women and the little ones, the livestock, and everything else in the city, all its spoil, you shall take as plunder for yourselves” (Deut. 20:13–14).

[^E-1]: Unless otherwise noted, all Scripture references are from the ESV Bible.

God’s intention for those outside the land of Canaan was peaceful labor under the authority of Israel. Even if war broke out, the enemy was not to be utterly destroyed, but would be enjoyed as spoil by the victor, Israel. The devotion to destruction was intended only for the inhabitants of Canaan, the land that God had given to Israel. In conquering these cities, Israel obeyed God and “devoted all in the city to destruction, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, with the edge of the sword” (Joshua 6:20–21).

# Purpose of the Violence

The two types of destruction described in Deuteronomy 20 served distinct purposes. God commanded Israel to utterly destroy those who occupied Canaan and to subject those who lived near Canaan. Therefore, the difference in the extent of violence was distinguished partly by the location of the city under conquest. However, merely Israel’s desire for land would not make it moral to utterly destroy a city. Only by God’s purposes could this devotion to destruction be justified, for in utterly destroying a people, Israel went beyond the standard rules of war. Even God’s desire to give Israel the land of Canaan does not provide sufficient moral ground for the total destruction of the inhabitants. Significantly, Joshua provides insight to the moral justification for the conquest of Canaan by the sword of Israel, writing, “For it was the Lord’s doing to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, in order that they should be devoted to destruction and should receive no mercy, but be destroyed, just as the LORD commanded Moses” (Joshua 11:20).

Therefore, God’s moral justification for devoting the Canaanites to destruction is found in their hardness of heart toward him. Furthermore, commenting on Deuteronomy 20:16-18, Peter Craigie writes:

> There are two reasons for this total destruction, only one of which is stated in this context. The unstated reason is that the Israelites were instruments of God's judgment; the conquest was not only the means by which God granted his people the promised land, but was also the means by which he executed his judgment on the Canaanites for their sinfulness (see 9:4). The second reason, which is stated, appears in v. 18; if the Canaanites survived, their unholy religion could turn Israel aside from serving the Lord.[^P-1]

[^P-1]: Craigie, 276.

Indeed, in Deuteronomy 9:5 the LORD says to Israel, “Because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God is driving them out from before you, and that he may confirm the word that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” Although Israel directly benefits from the conquest, God’s righteous justification for destroying the Canaanites is found in the wickedness of these people before the LORD. Even God’s initial covenant with Abraham anticipates the future judgment of the people of Canaan whose iniquity was “not yet complete” (Gen. 15:16). God delayed Israel’s occupation of Canaan so that the inhabitants would fulfill their iniquity and thus fully deserve being devoted to destruction. From the beginning of God’s covenant promises, he intended to use Israel as an instrument of wrath in order to punish and destroy the Canaanites for their iniquity.

# Christian Interpretation

The Canaanites are not the only people God has chosen to utterly destroy in our Scripture. By his own deed, God drowned (nearly) every living being upon the planet: men, women, children, and livestock. Leading up to the flood, “The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually” (Gen. 6:5). Furthermore, in Revelation, the third angel proclaims:

> If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink the wine of God's wrath poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name. (Rev. 14:9--11)

Indeed, the New Testament is filled with references to God’s destruction of his enemies, including Christ’s future torment of the demons (Matt. 8:29), the rich man’s torment in Hades (Luke 16:23), the “vessels of wrath prepared for destruction” (Rom. 9:22), and the ultimate destruction of those who “glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things” (Phil. 3:19). By his own righteousness, God has every moral right to utterly destroy, afflict, and torment his enemies by his own chosen instruments. As Paul wrote in 2 Thessalonians 1:5–10, the righteous judgment of God is evident in his afflicting those who afflict his chosen people. Furthermore, this righteous judgment includes “inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might” (2 Thess. 1:8–10). However, those who follow the Lord are “considered worthy of the kingdom of God” (2 Thess. 1:5) and will be counted as righteous and live forever in heavenly dwellings. Ultimately, God will destroy those who reject him and spare those who follow him.

# Conclusion

By account of Scripture, those who reject God merit his wrath and punishment by the instrument of his choosing. The people of the land of Canaan wholly rejected God and were thereby subject to destruction by his wrath through the instrument of the nation of Israel. In the same way, God flooded the earth in Noah’s day to utterly destroy those who had rejected him. In the eschaton, God will totally destroy all of his enemies in the terrors of the lake of fire. God was not inconsistent with himself in his treatment of the Canaanites whose hearts where hardened before him. The Canaanites rebelled against God and received just punishment for their sin. All who have rejected God ought to shudder at the prospect of receiving their just dessert, as the Canaanites received millennia ago and as all the enemies of God will receive in the eschaton. Graciously, God has given sinners the opportunity to be transformed from objects of wrath into objects of pleasure, by the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus. May we all seize such a merciful opportunity offered to us by a holy, righteous, and just God.
