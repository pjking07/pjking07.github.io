*The Soul Winner: How to Lead Sinners to the Saviour*. By Charles Spurgeon. Heraklion, 2013, 3425 locations, $0.99 Kindle. Reviewed by Vernon R. King, III.

# Summary

*The Soul Winner* is Charles Spurgeon’s renowned work exhorting Christians to instrumentally win souls for Christ. Spurgeon teaches that soul-winning, the instructing and impressing upon a man so "that he may know the truth of God" (loc. 99–100), is an important task in which every Christian should participate (loc. 3072). Through various means, Spurgeon calls on all Christians to evangelize the lost with the gospel, earnestly desiring that they win souls. Helpfully, Spurgeon also aids the reader in recognizing true conversion as true belief resulting in evidential true prayer (loc. 273).

As is explained in the *Prefatory Note*, the chapters are compiled from three types of sources: (1) Spurgeon’s lectures given to The Pastor’s College, (2) his addresses to teachers and preachers at prayer meetings, and (3) his sermons given at churches (loc. 16). While each source addresses a unique audience, the book effectively addresses all variety of Christians. Because each chapter represents a distinct sermon or lecture, each is filled with insight and exhortation to the task of evangelism for all believers.

# Contribution to Evangelism in the Local Church

Spurgeon’s writing does well to teach the ecclesiological nature of evangelism. When addressing future pastors, Spurgeon emphasizes the importance of winning souls for the sake of the kingdom, not merely one’s local church (loc. 40–42). Indeed, he serves the universal church well by exhorting pastors to work together for the gospel, rather than fighting each other for head-count. This is particularly evidenced in his exhortation to not steal sheep from other gospel churches (loc. 36). Furthermore, Spurgeon exhorts pastors in counting only proven conversions as true, for "to introduce unconverted persons to the church is to weaken and degrade it; and therefore an apparent gain may be a real loss" (loc. 54–55). Therefore, the convert must first be "tested and tried" before being affirmed into the church (loc. 356).

As a Calvinist evangelist, Spurgeon continually acknowledges the tension between the necessity of the work of God and the instrumentality of the work of man (loc. 862). Indeed, Spurgeon offers so much practical advice for the instrumental man of God that one might count him Finnian if he did not so often temper his advice by his theology. Christians would do well to imitate Spurgeon by working hard to keep this tension in view, thereby avoiding the temptation to view evangelism as either the work of man without the necessity of God or the work of God without the instrumentality of man.

Another contribution Spurgeon makes to the evangelistic efforts of the church is his desire to present the gospel in an accessible manner by using "market language" so that "we would have all classes of the community listening to our message" (loc. 920). Spurgeon does the church a service by exhorting the communication of the gospel in a manner that children and the uneducated can grasp. Furthermore, Spurgeon instructs Christian teachers to appeal to the hearts of their hearers, not firing "over their heads" or aiming "only at their intellects" and to ensure the instruction is "crammed full of the gospel" (loc. 1060, 1082–1084).

# Author’s Argumentation

As each chapter is a transcribed lecture or sermon, Spurgeon’s argumentation is didactically structured. Following the model of 2 Timothy 4:2, Spurgeon *patiently teaches* his audience the doctrines of conversion, evangelism, and human instrumentality. Furthermore, He continually *exhorts* the people to be prepared instruments of conversion because God has ordained such men to work toward the salvation of others. Such preparation includes personal holiness, prayer, passion, and practical matters of communication and speech. Finally, Spurgeon *reproves and rebukes* those who do not see evangelism and conversion as such an important task, those who steal sheep from other churches, and those who do not preach the gospel in the church. Throughout his teaching, Spurgeon’s personal passion for preaching and evangelism is evident, as is his desire for others to join him in the task of speaking the gospel to all who are lost.

# Key Quotes

> Those who do not like Jesus Christ must have Him preached to them till they do like Him; for they are the very people who need Him most. … We preach Jesus Christ to those who want Him, and we also preach Him to those who do not want Him, and we keep on preaching Christ until we make them feel that they do want Him, and cannot do without Him. (loc. 1078-1082)

> I command men in the name of Jesus to repent and believe the gospel, though I know they can do nothing of the kind apart from the grace of God. … Ours is the miraculous method which comes of the endowment of the Spirit of God, who bids His ministers perform wonders in the name of the holy child Jesus. We are sent to say to blind eyes, "See," to deaf ears, "Hear," to dead hearts, "Live," and even to Lazarus rotting in that grave, … "Lazarus, come forth." Dare we do this? We shall be wise to begin with the conviction that we are utterly powerless for this unless our Master has sent us, and is with us. But if He that sent us is with us, all things are possible to him that believeth. (loc. 1702–1708)
