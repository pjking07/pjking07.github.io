When reading John Calvin's *Institutes of the Christian Religion*, one has the opportunity to participate in a thorough biblical theology. The first five chapters of the first book of the *Institutes* begin Calvin's treatise on the knowledge of God, detailing the natural revelation of God to man and mankind's own stifling of such knowledge by sin. However, such a short read only begins to touch on Calvin's theological text.

Calvin warns against our human inability to grasp the fullness of God, especially when we begin from natural revelation, writing, "everyone appropriates to himself some peculiar error; but we are all alike in this, that we substitute monstrous fictions for the one living and true God" (1.5.11). While Calvin has more to say on this topic, this quote exemplifies his position: we all are in danger of subsituting "monstrous fictions" for the one true God. As I look ahead for this seminary semester, I have the opportunity to write numerous theological essays and papers; given my situation, I was struck to the quick by Calvin's warning. In my own pursuit of knowing God more and articulating my knowledge of him for the perusal of others, I have already felt the weight of possibly substituting a monstrous fiction for the real Lord. Even though God has been clear in his revelation of himself, I wonder if I might be so greatly stupid and dull as to derive no benefit from it (cf. 1.5.11). Worse, if I do not look upon God clearly, I may be "quite pleased with [my] own righteousness, wisdom, and virtue" (1.1.2). O How great is the danger of not knowing God rightly. 

Though I am deficient to comprehend the fullness of God, if I seek him in humility, with the Scripture as source, the Spirit as guide, and the Church as community, I trust God will continue to reveal himself to me through the knowledge of him. Praise God that he has given us the gift of faith and the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him (Eph. 1:17)!
