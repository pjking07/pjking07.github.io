The question, “Are people born guilty of sin?”, possesses a great deal of theological baggage. First, there is the doctrine of original sin, which implies that everyone is guilty before God, even prior to sinning, because of the sin of the common father, Adam. However, if people are conceived without guilt before God, the question becomes, “When might a person become guilty of sin?” But even that question ought to be preceeded by another question, namely, “At what point may a person be saved by grace through the gift of faith?” By answering these questions, we might have a better picture of the origins of sin and guilt.

Consider first John the Baptist, who is known for leaping for joy when he first met Jesus, even while both were *in utero* (Luke 1:41)! Indeed, when announcing the coming conception of John the Baptist to Zechariah, the messenger angel foretells, “[John] will be filled with the Holy Spirit, *even from his mother’s womb*” (Luke 1:15, emphasis added). Being filled with the Holy Spirit is also evidence of receiving the gift of faith from God (Eph. 2:8), because receiving the Holy Spirit is the seal of the guarantee of heavenly inheritance (Eph. 1:14). Therefore, John’s being filled with the Holy Spirit is evidence that, at least in such a special circumstance, God may grant the gift of faith even to the pre-born! As further evidence, the psalmist describes the Child who leans upon God from the womb and who trusts God as a nursing babe (Psalm 22:9; 71:6).

If a pre-born child can be filled with the Holy Spirit and lean upon the Lord and a nursing babe can be made to trust in God, then at what point is it possible for such a child to also sin against the holy God? Children come into this world kicking, screaming, and crying from their mothers’ wombs. As a child progresses in natural development, changes take place, enabling the child to exert his will upon the world. As any parent should be able to attest, there comes a point in time in development when the child shows his will to be sinful, whether by protesting a parent’s instruction or deliberately turning against it. Because the types of sin expressed by the child run parallel with his or her development, one may conclude that sin dwells within a child prior to any willful expression. Indeed, “Folly is bound up in the heart of a child” (Prov. 22:15).

Since infant and pre-born children have the potential both to sin and to be saved from sin, the issue of original guilt almost appears moot because depraved children are so quick to sin as it is. However, a few problems with original guilt must be addressed. First, if having a human parent means that one inherits the guilt of others’ sins, then Jesus would require an exception from the original sin passed through Mary. While Catholics attempt to avoid this problem with the doctrine of Mary’s immaculate conception, this conclusion seems to make Jesus’ human experience less than human and his temptations less than those experienced by mere humans. Second, being found *guilty* of your parents’ sin is inherently unjust, if one never actually commits sin. While receiving negative consequences for others’ sin is part of the fallen world, no one is counted guilty of uncommitted sin other than Jesus Christ, our substitute.

Are people born guilty of sin? Probably. However, the sin by which people are born guilty is their own sin, committed against a perfect and holy God. Therefore, praise God that he can save children, infants, and the pre-born by the same means he saves adults, namely, the good gift of faith.
