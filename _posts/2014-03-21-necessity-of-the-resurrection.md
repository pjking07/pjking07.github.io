The resurrection of the dead is too outrageous a concept for many outside the Christian faith to bear. Even some who claim to believe the teachings of the "historical Jesus" refuse to recognize the validity of the physical resurrection of his body. Given that some who call themselves Christians even reject the necessity of Jesus' bodily resurrection, orthodox Christians must be ready to answer the seemingly simple question, "Why was the resurrection of Jesus necessary for salvation?"

In 1^st^ Corinthians 15, Paul explains the salvific necessity of both Jesus' past, physical resurrection and our future, physical resurrection. As his argument goes, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins" (1 Cor. 15:17 [ESV]). Our faith would be futile because, as Paul also reiterates in Romans 5, by the sin of Adam, sin---and death through sin---entered the world. By the sin of Adam, all humanity is in the most pitiable state of being separated from God and enemies of the King. Through Adam's sin, compounded by each one's own sin, all humanity is spiritually dead and physically dead or dying.

What does humanity need to be saved from if not from both kinds of death? If a man could be saved from physical death, but not sin (spiritual death), then he would be revived only to sin again, leading once more to physical death. This would lead to repeated reincarnation, not resurrection, and surely not salvation. If not that, then being saved from death alone would lead to a life in limbo in which man is separated from God, experiencing spiritual death, but is somehow protected from physical death. Again, such an experience would be far from the promised eternal life in the presence of the Son.

If a man could be saved from sin, but not death, then what great benefit is that? If there is only the cessation of life following this one, then mankind would be motivated primarily by hedonistic pleasure. As Paul writes well, "If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. . . . If the dead are not raised, 'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die'" (1 Cor. 15:18, 32 [ESV]). Without the promise of everlasting life and reward, humans have no motivation today to live any life other than that which pleases them.

Having established our need for salvation from both types of death, let's consider the necessity of Christ's death and resurrection. If Christ died, but was not raised from the dead, then his death would likely have accomplished nothing. Even if Christ's death alone paid for sin, then we would still be lost to death. Indeed, if Christ died without being raised, then he is the firstfruits of our death---the end. If Christ is not raised, then he has ceased to exist, and has no power to save us. Only by participating in the resurrection of Christ can we receive salvation. Without Christ's own resurrection, we would have no resurrection and would still be lost to the last enemy---death.

"As in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Cor. 15:22). We, who are born spiritually dead and succumbing to physical death, shall be made alive both spiritually and physically because of Jesus' conquering of spiritual and physical death on Easter Sunday. Only by Christ's resurrection may we participate in the resurrection, without which there would be no salvation and those who die in Christ will simply cease to exist. Praise God that he has conquered the last enemy, death, through the resurrection of Christ Jesus.
