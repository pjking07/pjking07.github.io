As Christians, we affirm the Triune God: Father, Son, and Spirit. These Persons are coequal in glory and coeternal in majesty (*Athanasian Creed* [AC], 6). What the Father speaks, the Son does by the effectual Spirit. All works of God are done in the fullness of God with each Person uniquely acting behind a perfectly unified will.

Alas, the fullness of the Godhead and his threeness is impossible for us to fully understand. Indeed, we Christians are humbled by the task of systematizing the inner workings of the Triune God. Our difficulty first lies in the infinitude of God and the finitude of mankind. We fail to understand the Trinity because we are not God, nor do we have the full mind of God. Even with the scriptural testimony to the Triune God, our finite minds can barely fathom God in three persons. 

Unfortunately, many inadequate analogies and explanations have been developed over the ages in an attempt to describe the nature of the Trinity. For example, the Trinity has been incorrectly likened to the three states of water (ice, liquid, vapor). Heretically, that analogy depicts modalism, the belief that the one God reveals himself to us phenomenologically in different modes.[^1] Thankfully, the Athanasian Creed systematically defines the Christian understanding of the Trinitarian God as He has revealed himself. In many ways and with many examples, the creed essentially expounds one idea: "we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance" (AC, 3--4).

[^1]: For a humorous take on this, see [St. Patrick's Bad Analogies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQLfgaUoQCw).

Notably, the creed includes a serious statement: "He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity" (AC, 28). Considering this statement, we must ask, "Can someone be a Christian without believing in the Triune God?" Athanasius, to whom the creed is traditionally credited, was debating Arius, a heretic who taught that Christ was created and subordinate to God the Father. The context and the tone of the creed shows itself to be a response to those who reject and teach against the Triune God, therefore, the creed unlikely intends to condemn those ignorant within the faith. Rather than condemning those in the faith who ignorantly misbelieve the nature of the Triune God, the Athanasian Creed can be interpreted as anathematizing only those who knowingly reject the Trinity.

Ignorance, therefore, should be the distinguishing factor in determining whether a non-trinitarian might be a Christian. Consider the thief who converted while hanging on a cross: is it reasonable to assume he had a full understanding of the trinitarian nature of God? This man expressed his faith, saying, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom" (Luke 23:42 [ESV]); he affirms that Jesus is Messiah and Lord. However, we are ignorant as to his understanding of Jesus' precise relationship to the Father, to say nothing of the presence and nature of the Holy Spirit. Ought we to count such a man as a Christian? This man had little (no?) opportunity to be taught the depths of the Trinity, yet Jesus, the Son of God, responded to this man's profession of faith, saying, "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise" (Luke 23:43 [ESV]).

None of us understand the threeness of our God perfectly; we all worship the Triune God with degrees of ignorance because of our finitude. Therefore, one may be a Christian living under the Lordship of Jesus Christ without properly understanding God's threeness. However, to reject the Trinity would be to think and speak unChristianly. While the noetic minimum of salvific faith is known by God alone, anyone who expressly rejects God as Trinity cannot be affirmed to be a Christian.
