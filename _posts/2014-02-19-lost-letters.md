Paul’s conversion on the road to Damascus was particularly miraculous. Despite his own persecution of the early church, Paul was chosen by God to be an apostle. Speaking to Ananias, the Lord described Paul as “a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel” (Acts 9:15 [ESV]). From there, Paul went on to serially plant churches with other apostolic helpers and maintained relationships with such churches via the medium of the day: letters. In these letters, Paul exhorts, instructs, encourages, and disciplines the flock and leaders of his beloved churches.

As of today, every extant epistle that Paul wrote to his churches exists within the canon of Scripture. Working backward, these letters were officially recognized by the church as canonical by councils in the fourth and fifth centuries. The councils recognized the canonicity of the letters because they had been accepted as Scripture by the church for hundreds of years. Indeed, within decades of having been written, these select Pauline epistles were bound together and accepted as authoritative. Even Peter seemed to view Paul’s writing as having the authority of Scripture (2 Pet. 3:14–16). Therefore, our canonized epistles from Paul have been recognized as Scripture since the era in which they written.

However, we know that Paul wrote other epistles to his churches than the ones we have canonized. Indeed, references to non-extant letters show that the epistles we know as 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians are part of a longer series of letters from the apostle Paul to the church in Corinth. Since we know Paul wrote these other letters (and presumably many more), we may wonder how we should respond to the potential discovery of other Pauline epistles. We have already canonized every one of Paul’s letters that we know exists; what should we do if we discover more?

As Christians, we believe that the Scriptures are not merely authoritative, but are inspired by the Holy Spirit and are therefore without error. Furthermore, we affirm that the canon of Scripture is closed; no writings shall be added or removed. Therefore, as Christians, we hold that no other document has either scriptural authority or the inerrant inspiration of the Holy Spirit.

Paul’s canonized epistles are special because the Holy Spirit inspired them; his other writings were not so inspired. The early church recognized the difference in Paul’s (and others’) epistles and collected those known to have scriptural authority for the church universal. The same churches that affirmed some of the Pauline epistles as inspired did not offer the same affirmation for the remainder of his writings. Indeed, we do not have extant copies of Paul’s other epistles today because the church did not affirm them to be Scripture and did not consider them to be worth reproducing.

The writings that the early church affirmed to be inspired were copied, collected, and distributed to the other churches. Every apostolic letter and document of the day left out of these collations was judged by the early church to not be universally authoritative. The early church, by the guidance of the Holy Spirit, identified those writings that were inspired by the same Spirit. Any Pauline letter we may discover today would not be considered Scripture because the early church has already judged it to be sub-scriptural! The prolific apostle Paul may have been the author, but without the byline of the Holy Spirit, such a document exists without scriptural authority. Therefore, the epistle would be counted as another Christian writing, but would not provide any new revelation for the church today. All the contents of a discovered letter would need to be judged in light of the true Scripture.
