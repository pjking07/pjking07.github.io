In his historic sermon, Jonathan Edwards launches from Matthew 16:17 to argue that true knowledge of God, a divine and supernatural light, is immediately imparted to the soul by the Spirit of God. Specifically, Edwards' thesis reads, "That there is such a thing as a spiritual and divine light immediately imparted to the soul by God, of a different nature from any that is obtained by natural means." Although God is the author of all knowledge, natural knowledge may be learned by natural means by the gift of common grace, while spiritual knowledge must be divinely imparted by particular grace. 

For the unregenerate, the Holy Spirit works as "an extrinsic occasional agent," while the Spirit "acts in the mind of a saint as an indwelling vital principle." This divine knowledge is not new revelation, but is the affirmation of what the word of God already reveals. Furthermore, Edwards emphasizes that such knowledge is not merely cognitive, but rather must include the affections of the heart. 

For Edwards, this divine light is tied directly to regeneration and salvation, "a true and saving belief". The impartation of divine light is a gift of God and is unattainable by human effort. Furthermore, the result of divine light is both noetic and affectionate, indeed, experiential. Ultimately, this divine light is a unique expression for the reality of conversion, or, as Edwards defines it, "a true sense of the divine excellency of the things revealed in the word of God, and a conviction of truth and reality of them thence arising." 

Edwards rightly distinguishes between humanly attainable knowledge and spiritually imparted revelation. Indeed, all of mankind has the natural potential to learn the stories and propositions of the Bible. However, without faith, such knowledge will not be effective for knowing God himself. Even though God has revealed himself through his Scripture, our fallenness and separation from the divine necessitates that God must change our hearts before we may receive his divine knowledge. Without our own conversion, the turning from our own sinfulness, we can never know the true holiness of God. Indeed, as Edwards alludes, we all live in the darkness until Christ's light is shone upon us by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, Edwards rightly concludes that "this doctrine may lead us to reflect on the goodness of God" because anyone of any means may receive such the impartation of divine light. We must all examine ourselves for this light and seek it out if we have it not.
