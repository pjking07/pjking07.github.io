Bob Kauflin has written a helpful theology and practice of worship ministry in his book *Worship Matters*. This book is divided into many small chapters; selected chapters will be noted in brief.

# So What Does a Worship Leader Do?

"In a culture infatuated with musical experience and expression, worship leaders can be erroneously expected to lead us into God's presence" (p. 53). In light of this type of misunderstanding of the role of a worship leader, the church must identify and communicate the proper role of worship leaders. Although the term "worship leader" can add to the confusion, Kauflin prefers to keep the term because "it succinctly communicates that our goal is to lead others in praising God" (p. 54). Kauflin then identifies a lengthy working definition for "worship leader". I agree with Kauflin that the term is useful if properly defined and understood by the congregation. However, churches must be careful to communicate what the term means and how the congregation should participate in worship throughout the service.

# Guiding Principles

Whether high-church or low-church, every church uses a liturgy to guide its congregational gatherings. Rather than subscribing to explicitly to either the regulative or normative principles, Kauflin recommends three principles for guiding services: (1) Do what God clearly commands, (2) Don't do what God clearly forbids, and (3) Use scriptural wisdom for everything else (p. 155). I appreciate Kauflin's approach because it highlights the best of both principles. Within this, Kauflin recognizes a tension between possible directions and uses remaining chapters to walk through some of the tensions he finds in leading worship.

# Head and Heart

In leading worship, one persistent tension is between the head and the heart. Neither emotions nor knowledge are the goal of worship; the goal of worship is corporately knowing and glorifying God. However, both head and heart ought to be properly engaged in worshiping God. The truth ought to affect our emotions and we must base our emotions in truth. Through my Christian life, I have been a member of churches across the spectrum of prioritizing truth over emotion or prioritizing emotion over truth. Both directions of error lead to inadequate worship. 

# Internal and External

Another tension for Kauflin is internal worship and external expression. In leading a church to god-honoring expressiveness, Kauflin recommends four guidelines: (1) Direct people's attention to God and the gospel, (2) Teach about the appropriateness and limitations of physical expression, (3) Address hindrances to physical expression in worship, and (4) Teach consideration of others. Kauflin writes, "God-honoring expressiveness in corporate worship begins with clearly seeing the One we worship" (p. 170). Our expressiveness in worship ought to reflect our worship of God and in light of the truth we are receiving. However, physical expressiveness cannot be a determining factor for the quality of one's worship. While such the appropriateness of given expressions will vary based on culture and context, one should have religious affections toward God and express them with his person in worship.

# Skilled and Authentic

Excellence in a worship leader and musical team must involve both character and musical skill. I have been involved with some ministries in which those "leading worship" loved playing in a band but had no relationship with God. In this sense, Christian character is far more important than musical skill. Furthermore, the skill of a musician is only helpful inasmuch as it promotes worship within the congregation. Kauflin writes, "Worship isn't just about what's happening between me and God---it concerns *us* and God" (p 197). The worship leader ought to be leading  the church in authentic worship while worshiping God himself. 

# For the Church and for Unbelievers

Some debate whether the congregational gathering ought to be primarily for equipping the saints or evangelizing the lost. However, the church gathering is simply that---the gathering of the body of Christ. Even though this gathering is for the church, unbelievers will (and should) attend. With this in mind, we ought to structure our services to be seeker discernible so that we can proclaim the gospel in a sensible form (cf. 1 Cor. 14:26--40). Kauflin writes, "Imagine the effect if *church growth* referred to churches growing in their understanding of the gospel, personal godliness, involvement in the church, and their heart for the lost rather than simply numbers" (p. 202). What we all need to hear is the repeated message of the gospel. This message will always be useful for all types of people, believer and unbeliever alike.
