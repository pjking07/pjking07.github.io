Mark Dever's _The Church_ is an expansion of a chapter he previously contributed to Danny Akin's systematic theology textbook, _A Theology for the Church_. This work is distinguished from typical 9Marks publications in that its scope is broader, its tone more formal, and its content more academic. Although Dever explains the theological nature of all local churches, he unabashedly shows his roots by arguing for his particular vision of the church. While pastors and theologians of all ecclesiastical backgrounds can benefit from Dever's work, _The Church_ was originally written for a Baptist theological textbook by a Baptist pastor-theologian to promote a distinct Baptist ecclesiology.

Dever writes _The Church_ for an audience living in a theological context of ambivalence. The author states, "For too many Christians today, the doctrine of the church is . . . unimportant because it bears no weight" (ix). According with the subtitle of the book, "The Gospel Made Visible", Dever demonstrates the relationship between the church and the gospel. Although "Christian proclamation might make the gospel audible," Dever writes, "Christians living together in local congregations make the gospel visible" (xi). One's understanding of the church directly affects one's demonstration of the gospel itself.

One of the most intriguing additions to Dever's expansion of his textbook segment is his chapter on social justice, "The Hope of the Church". Dever concludes, "congregations *may* take action in the cause of this-worldly justice, but they are not required to" (81). This chapter impedes the rhetorical flow of Dever's ecclesiological argument by sandwiching a non-starter between the glorious purpose and final consummation of the church. Perhaps the chapter, which reads as an addendum, would have been better suited for the appendix.

In _The Church_, Dever defines the church in two discrete ways. First, he writes, "The church is the body of people called by God's grace through faith in Christ to glorify him together by serving him in his world" (3). Second, Dever defines a true church as one marked by "the right preaching of the Word of God and the right administration of baptism and the Lord's Supper" (21). Unfortunately, "right" is a subjective qualifier for the practice of preaching, baptism, and the Lord's Supper. Indeed, if Dever consistently holds to this ordinance-driven definition of a true church, then his own Presbyterian friends at his cross-denominational Together for the Gospel conference are pastoring gatherings that are not *true* churches. Dever's delineation between a church and a true church creates a false dichotomy; if a church is not a *true* church, then it is a *false* church. Rather than attempt to distinguish true churches based on their observance of the ordinances, Dever ought to simply identify the ordinances and establish how they ought to be practiced. This would allow all churches to be identified as such, even if they maintain a deficient view of the ordinances. Without maintaining a consistently catholic definition of the church, ecclesiological discussions will founder when crossing denominational divides.

_The Church_ is salient to all pastors and church leaders, since all ought to consider what is "a right ecclesiology" that "touches on God's glory itself" (149). While Dever writes this book for a primarily Baptist audience, he acknowledges readers from other denominations and attempts to persuade them of his particular ecclesiology. Dever generally succeeds at his goal of providing an accessible primer on the doctrine of the church regardless of the reader's denominational identity. I recommend this book to  committed readers of any denominational background seeking an introduction to ecclesiology.
