Mark Dever and Paul Alexander write _The Deliberate Church_ in order to communicate "a vision of a whole church deliberately ordered and led so as to facilitate its own edification and ministry" (202). The sequel to the theological and conceptual _Nine Marks of a Healthy Church_, this book is extremely practical. Instead of structuring _The Deliberate Church_ around the nine marks from Dever's seminal work, though, the authors catalog the advice Dever often dispenses to visiting pastors. Hence, Dever and Alexander orient their book around the functional expressions of the gathered church. They offer numerous nuggets of insight in various sections, namely, "Gathering the Church", "When the Church Gathers", "Gathering Elders", and "When the Elders Gather". Their advice covers topics ranging from removal of members to installation of elders, from musical worship to members' meetings, and from personal discipleship to pastoral staffing.

As a work dedicated to the practical outworking of a particular ecclesiology, this book will most help those pastors and churches that are already following the model presented by Mark Dever and Capitol Hill Baptist Church. However, given its breadth of topics, most readers should find this book a helpful resource for considering anew various aspects of their local church. Indeed, one can use _The Deliberate Church_ as a reference and an inspiration for addressing particular, practical problems in the local church. Unfortunately, the structure that makes this work also causes the book to sound somewhat repetitive---it offers some of the same advice in multiple sections throughout, e.g., advice about praying through the membership directory, keeping the deacons informed before members' meetings, and interviewing members and candidates.

While some of the advisory sections clearly relate to the aforementioned nine marks of a healthy church, others merely build upon that framework. For example, Dever and Alexander dedicate a chapter to musical worship when worship itself is not among the nine marks. The authors do a good job demonstrating the importance of intentionality in all aspects of the church service, such as music. Within that particular chapter, the authors promote what they call "congregational singing", a methodology that minimizes performers, increases congregational participation, and maximizes corporate worship. Rather than delegating the planning and direction of the church's music, Dever and Alexander advocate planning blocks of services months in advance in order to guide the church in increasing musical skill, song variety, theological lyrics, and participation.

As evidenced by the chapter on music, one of the authors' goals is to give the reader "freedom from both the tyranny of the new and the tyranny of the urgent" through deliberate planning (127). While some of Dever and Alexander's advice is imminently helpful, much of the wisdom contained in this book requires patient planning and execution on the part of pastors. Indeed, the most helpful piece of advice the authors give is to be patient. Without patience and a long-term view of church reform, pastors might even find the contents of this book discouraging. To combat this, Dever writes, "Get used to thinking in terms of years rather than just weeks or months. It'll preserve your pastoral sanity---trust me" (191).

_The Deliberate Church_ does not provide pastors with quick fixes, sure-fire programs, or pre-baked solutions. Instead, it uses the regulative principle to exhort its readers to seek God and his design for the local church as revealed in Scripture. Dever and Alexander encourage pastors to teach Scripture to the congregation while patiently and deliberately implementing God's design in the church. Along the way, the authors proffer much practical insight and advice while perennially pointing back to fundamental principles. For this reason, pastors will benefit from reading this book soberly, sincerely, and deliberately.
