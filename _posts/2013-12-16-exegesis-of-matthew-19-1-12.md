# Introduction

Divorce and remarriage is a pastoral concern that has directly or indirectly affected many in the church today. Systematizing all of the biblical passages relevant to marriage is a difficult task that has led to a wide variety of opinions regarding one’s moral permission to divorce and remarry. While the exceptive clause in verse 9 increases the difficulty of systematization, the meaning of this text does not hinge on this clause. The essence of Matthew 19:1--12 is Jesus’ affirmation of God’s original ideal of the indissolubility of marriage.

# Historical Analysis

The Gospel of Matthew is the only canonical Gospel to have a disputed original language. While there is common knowledge of the history and authenticity of the Greek version of Matthew’s Gospel, the early church fathers also referenced a Hebrew version. The earliest extant reference to a possible Hebrew Matthew comes from a quotation of Papias, a second-century bishop, as recorded by the early historian Eusebius.[^H-1a] Eusebius and the early church fathers believed the Gospel of Matthew was originally authored by the apostle in Hebrew or Aramaic and was subsequently translated into Greek.[^H-1b] However, modern scholars widely affirm that the Greek Matthew is an original writing, not a translation from another language.[^H-1c]

Given the conflicting accounts from modern analysis and early church attestations, most contemporary scholars assert that Papias was either wrong or has been misinterpreted. However, these claims could be reconciled if the Greek Matthew were shown to be a newer edition of a Semitic version, not a direct translation of it.[^H-2a] Notably, Hebrew versions of the Gospel of Matthew exist today, including Shem-Tob’s Matthew, which is a complete Hebrew manuscript found within a fourteenth century Jewish polemical treatise.[^H-2b] George Howard profiled Shem-Tob’s Matthew and concluded, "Both the Hebrew and the Greek represent original compositions in their own respective languages with one serving as a literary model for the other."[^H-2c]

While Shem-Tob’s Matthew appears to have no direct relation to the Hebrew Matthew quoted by the church fathers,[^H-3a] the literary data allows for the possibility of an original Greek Matthew and an original Hebrew Matthew co-existing in antiquity. Therefore, the existence of an original Greek Matthew does not necessarily prove wrong the early church fathers’ reference to an original Hebrew Matthew. Regardless of the possible existence of an apocryphal Hebrew Matthew, the text of the Greek will continue to be that which the church did canonize. From this canonized text, one can know that Matthew, a Jewish Christian, wrote his Gospel to the Hebrews, in the style of the Hebrews, and for the sake of the Hebrews.[^H-3b]

# Lexical Analysis

**ἀπολύω.** Various forms of ἀπολύω are used in this pericope and are translated, "to divorce" (v. 3, 8), "to send her away" (v. 7), and "divorces" (v. 9).[^L-a-1a] Robinson’s lexicon defines ἀπολύω simply as "I let loose, set free, release, permit to depart,"[^L-a-1b] while Louw & Nida adds "divorce" and "forgive."[^L-a-1c] More thoroughly, BDAG defines the Matthew 19 use of ἀπολύω as "to dissolve a marriage relationship, to divorce one’s wife or betrothed."[^L-a-1d] Significantly, the repeated use of ἀπολύω allows for a consistent view of divorce throughout the passage.

[^L-a-1a]: Unless otherwise indicated, all Scripture quotations are from the ESV Bible.

[^L-a-1b]: Maurice A. Robinson and Mark A. House, *Analytical Lexicon of New Testament Greek*, Rev. ed. (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2012), s.v. ἀπολύω.

[^L-a-1c]: L&N, s.v. ἀπολύω.

[^L-a-1d]: BDAG, s.v. ἀπολύω.

**συζεύγνυμι, χωρίζω.** In his initial answer to the Pharisees, Jesus responded, "What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate" (v. 6). "Joined together" comes from the Greek συζεύγνυμι, which BDAG defines as "to make a pair, join together, pair, specifically of matrimony."[^L-S-1a]  "Separate" is a form of the word, χωρίζω, which Louw & Nida defines as "separate, divorce, depart, remove."[^L-X-1a] In regard to this pericope, BDAG defines χωρίζω as "to cause separation through use of space between, divide, separate." Significantly, these verbs for "joined together" and "separate" are not nuanced in their meaning, thereby aiding interpretation.

[^L-S-1a]: BDAG, s.v. συζεύγνυμι.

[^L-X-1a]: L&N, s.v. χωρίζω.

**ἐντέλλω, ἐπιτρέπω.** When the Pharisees further question Jesus in verse 7, they mention Moses’ command (ἐντέλλω) to give a certificate of divorce. However, Jesus responds that Moses allowed (ἐπιτρέπω) divorce. BDAG defines ἐντέλλω as "to give or leave instructions, command, order, give orders,"[^L-E-1a] and ἐπιτρέπω as "to allow someone to do something, allow, permit."[^L-E-1b] Because these do not appear to be synonymous, one could interpret significance into Jesus’ rephrasing from ἐντέλλω to ἐπιτρέπω. However, one must be aware that the Markan parallel reverses the speaker of each verb, with Jesus using ἐντέλλω and the Pharisees using ἐπιτρέπω, thereby minimizing any supposed significance in the use of these terms.

[^L-E-1a]: BDAG, s.v. ἐντέλλω.

[^L-E-1b]: BDAG., s.v. ἐπιτρέπω.

**πορνεία.** The phrase, μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ, translated by the ESV as "except for sexual immorality," is perhaps the most controversial phrase in this text. Robinson defines πορνεία as "fornication" and "habitual immorality."[^L-P-1a] Louw & Nida defines πορνεία as "to engage in sexual immorality of any kind" and makes a note that πορνεία is sometimes used specifically to refer to incest.[^L-P-1b] Regarding this passage, BDAG defines πορνεία as either "sexual unfaithfulness of a married woman" or "participation in prohibited degrees of marriage, fornication," e.g., incest. Overall, πορνείᾳ represents the category of sexual immorality but may also refer to a specific type of sexual immorality as the context allows.[^L-P-1c]

[^L-P-1a]: Robinson, s.v. πορνεία.

[^L-P-1b]: L&N, §88.271.

[^L-P-1c]: BDAG, s.v. πορνεία; R. T. France, *The Gospel of Matthew*, New International Commentary on the New Testament (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2007), 209.

# Structural Analysis

The narrative structural diagram shows multiple questions being asked and answered regarding the topic of marriage. Significantly, Jesus answers the Pharisees’ first question on the lawfulness of divorce by explaining God’s intention for marriage as revealed in creation, which is structurally seen to be Jesus’ core teaching in this passage. The remainder of Jesus’ responses clarifies his primary teaching given in verses 4--6. As the structure reveals, Jesus’ response to the Pharisees’ test ultimately silences the Pharisees and shocks the disciples. Ultimately, these reactions ought to guide one’s interpretation of the text.

- Characters
	- Jesus (v. 1)
	- Large crowds (v. 2)
	- Pharisees (v. 3)
	- Disciples (v. 10)
- Setting
	- where: Judea beyond the Jordan (v. 1)
	- when: After Jesus went away from Galilee (v. 1)
	- what: Pharisees testing Jesus before the large crowds (vv. 2--3)
- Plot
	1. Jesus is healing before the crowds (v. 2)
	2. (problem) Pharisees test Jesus by asking about lawful divorce (v. 3).
	3. (resolution) Jesus answers with God's marital ideal revealed in creation (vv. 4--6).
	4. (problem) Pharisees rebut with Moses' command of a certificate of divorce (v. 7).
	5. (resolution) Jesus rebukes the Pharisees, revealing adultery as the consequence of divorce and remarriage (vv. 8--9).
	6. (problem) Shocked, the disciples claim it is better to not marry (v. 10).
	7. (resolution) Jesus teaches the non-universal nature of celibacy (vv. 11--13).
- Result
	- The Pharisees' testing failed and they had no response to Jesus' answer.
	- Jesus’ teaching on divorce shocked the disciples.
	- Jesus reveals some are called to celibacy for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

# Contextual Analysis

## Matthean Context

Matthew 19:1--2 shows that this passage begins the transition from Jesus’ Galilean ministry to his Judean ministry. This passage follows Jesus’ fourth discourse, which Carson titles, "Life under Kingdom Authority" and begins the narrative section that leads into Passion Week.[^C-B-1a] This passage immediately precedes Jesus’ teaching on children and follows the "Parable of the Unforgiving Servant." Significantly, forgiveness may still be in view as Matthew transitions into Jesus’ teaching about divorce.

[^C-B-1a]: Carson, 82.

In the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew records another instance of Jesus’ teaching on marriage. In Matthew 5:31--32, Jesus references Deuteronomy 24:1--4 with the introductory formula, "it was also said," followed by his interpretation of the law. Given the formula, one would expect Jesus’ interpretation to reveal the heart of the law as God originally intended. While Jesus’ phrasing in 5:32 includes a similar exceptive clause as 19:9, the resultant adultery is different. Matthew 5:32 reads, "[the husband] makes her commit adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery," while 19:9 reads, "[the husband] commits adultery."

## Gospel Context

Targeting a Gentile audience, Mark 10:1--12 parallels Matthew’s account of the Pharisees’ testing of Jesus. While these passages have differently ordered dialogues, the most significant difference occurs in Matthew 19:9 and Mark 10:11--12. First, Mark has no exceptive clause as found in Matthew 5:32 and 19:9. Second, Matthew’s account only discusses husband-initiated divorce, while Mark’s specifically includes the case of a wife divorcing her husband. Notably, Roman and Greek divorce laws permitted either spouse to initiate a divorce while Jewish law only permitted husband-initiated divorce.[^C-B-Mark-1a] This contextual difference in divorce laws should prove significant in one’s interpretation of the seeming discontinuity between the Markan and Matthean accounts. In short, Mark presents Jesus’ teaching against divorce as a universal command, thereby judging as an adulterer whoever divorces his or her spouse and remarries.

[^C-B-Mark-1a]: R. T. France, *The Gospel of Mark*, New International Greek Testament Commentary (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2002), 393.

Also targeting a Gentile audience, Luke 16:18 presents Jesus’ teaching on divorce in a single sentence. This parallel shares the universal, non-exceptive message of Mark but renders adulterous judgment on the divorcing husband and the man who marries a divorced woman. As in Mark, Luke’s account of Jesus’ teaching makes no allowance for moral remarriage following one’s initiation of divorce.

## Cultural Context

In the early first century, the rabbinic schools of Hillel and Shammai were debating the proper justification of lawful divorce. Both groups viewed the regulation in Deuteronomy 24:1--4 as permitting divorce, but disagreed on the interpretation of עֶרְוַ֣ת דָּבָ֔ר ("something indecent").[^C-C-1b] In summary, "[Shammai] interpreted the expression to refer to gross indecency, though not necessarily adultery; Hillel extended the meaning beyond sin to all kinds of real or imagined offenses, including an improperly cooked meal."[^C-C-1c] If the Pharisees were motivated to test Jesus because of this rabbinic debate, then they likely intended to force him into publicly committing to an interpretation antagonistic to one or both schools of thought.[^C-C-1a]

This debate regarding justified divorce was also likely to be fiscally significant. In the Ancient Near East, the husband who could prove proper justification for his divorce was entitled to keep the bridal dowry. However, without proven justification, the husband was required to repay the dowry and possibly an extra penalty.[^C-C-1e] Separately, the Pharisees may have had in view the Herod-Herodias affair, which had been condemned by John the Baptist as an unlawful relationship. With this affair in view, the testing could have been potentially explosive if the crowd included John’s disciples, the Herodians, and other devout Jews who hated Herod.[^B-H-1b]

# Meaning Analysis

Matthew 19:1 transitions from Jesus’ prior discourse into a new narrative section and marks the beginning of Jesus’ ministry in Judea. Verse 2 mentions the large crowds following Jesus and Jesus’ continued healing of them, as he had done in Galilee.[^M-1a] The transition into verse 3 likely shows that the Pharisees’ testing of Jesus was in front of these crowds. This public testing of Jesus likely occurred in order to incite an outcry against Jesus and his teaching.[^S-I-1a] To begin their testing, the Pharisees ask, "Is it lawful to divorce one’s wife for any cause?" (v. 3). Because the question included the phrase, "for any cause," it seems that the Pharisees had the Shammai v. Hillel debate in view.[^M-1b] Regardless, R. T. France rightly presumes that one should "understand the Pharisees to be deliberately broaching a controversial issue."[^M-1c]

Jesus first responds to the Pharisees’ testing by appealing to the Creator, saying, "He who created them from the beginning made them male and female" (Matt. 19:4). This is a paraphrase of Genesis 1:27: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them." By Jesus’ account, the same God who made man and woman also said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh" (Matt. 19:5, quoting Gen. 2:24). From these two truths in Genesis, Jesus concludes, "What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate" (Matt. 19:6). Therefore, Jesus’ response to the Pharisees comes directly from God’s pre-fallen design in creation and teaches the ideal of the indissolubility of marriage. Furthermore, this "aligns [Jesus] with the prophet Malachi, who quotes Yahweh as saying, ‘I hate divorce’ (2:16)."[^M-2a] Therefore, with no explicit exception, Jesus’ initial response to the testing of the Pharisees teaches that man ought not separate what God has joined in marriage.[^M-2b] Jesus’ teaching of the indissolubility of marriage ought to strongly influence one’s interpretation of the entirety of this passage.

[^M-2a]: Carson, 466.

[^M-2b]: Donald A. Hagner, *Matthew 14--28*, Word Biblical Commentary 33B (Dallas: Word, 1995), 548.

Seemingly unfazed by Jesus' response, the Pharisees continue in their testing, demanding that Jesus explain Moses' "command" to give a certificate of divorce (v. 7). This new question is a direct reference to Deuteronomy 24:1--4, which was also explicitly in view in Jesus' teaching on divorce from the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5:31--32). Not at all a command regarding divorce, the Deuteronomic regulation prohibits a man from remarrying his ex-wife if she had already remarried another man. The law itself presumes a certificate of divorce, but does not explicitly regulate its usage. As the law is written, the protasis consists of verses 1--3 and the apodosis does not begin until verse 4.[^C-B-2b] Therefore, "the legislation here neither commands nor condones divorce in general but only regulates its practice for ancient Israel."[^C-B-2a] While the passage states that the man divorced his wife for עֶרְוַ֣ת דָּבָ֔ר ("some indecency"), it does not teach that it was moral or right for him to do so. Notably, other laws required the stoning of women who were caught in adultery or fornication, thus making the original meaning of עֶרְוַ֣ת דָּבָ֔ר something other than unchastity.[^C-B-2c] Therefore, if πορνείᾳ is taken to mean unchastity or adultery, then Jesus' use of πορνείᾳ in Matthew 19:9 is unlikely to be synonymous with the original interpretation of עֶרְוַ֣ת דָּבָ֔ר.

[^C-B-2a]: Eugene H. Merrill, *Deuteronomy*, New American Commentary 4 (Nashville: Broadman and Holman, 1994), 316; cf. Deuteronomy 22:20--21.

Regarding this final test, Jesus explains that Moses permitted divorce because of Israel's hardness of heart, "but from the beginning it was not so" (v. 8). Jesus returns to God's ideal of indissoluble marriage as he had previously explained and begins to associate divorce with sin ("hardness of heart"). After again mentioning God’s ideal for marriage, Jesus teaches that the consequence of initiating divorce and remarrying is adultery (v. 9). However, this consequence is modified by the exceptive clause, μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ. Whatever its meaning, this clause must be interpreted in light of Jesus' prior, explicit teaching on the indissolubility of marriage.

In response to Jesus’ teaching on marriage, the disciples are shocked and respond, "it is better not to marry" (v. 10). The reaction of the disciples ought to influence one’s interpretation of Jesus’ teaching. First, their response demonstrates that Jesus’ teaching is "more narrow than they had themselves viewed the subject."[^M-B-5a] Second, Jesus’ instruction was likely considered to be narrower than both the schools of Hillel and Shammai. Rejecting the disciples’ claim that celibacy is better than marriage, Jesus teaches that some are celibate by birth and some by the action of men, but others are celibate "for the sake of the kingdom of heaven" (v. 12). However, not everyone can receive such a call to celibacy (v. 11). Therefore, the disciples’ shocked response is shown to be true, but only for those who have been called to celibacy.[^M-B-5b]

## The Exception Clause

Jesus first responded to the testing of the Pharisees with God’s ideal of the indissolubility of marriage. This truth is the essence of Jesus’ teaching on marriage. Therefore, any consideration of divorce shows that at least one spouse is guilty of being hard-hearted and any subsequent action of divorce and remarriage results in adultery. While the thrust of Jesus’ teaching on marriage is discernible in verses 4--8, interpretive questions remain regarding verse 9 because of the exceptive clause, μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ, "except for sexual immorality." The scope of this paper prohibits a full treatment of the interpretive options of μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ, therefore, a subset of the options will be briefly noted. As a curated list, the following options are limited to those that affirm the non-exceptive nature of Jesus’ teaching in verse 6 and Mark 10:11--12.

One view interprets Deuteronomy 24:1--4 as being a regulation for divorce during the betrothal period. Notably, the language of Deuteronomy 24:1 hints of a discovery of דָּבָ֔ר עֶרְוַ֣ת ("some indecency") early in the marriage and verse 5 renders another law regarding newlyweds. Significantly, the word for divorce, ἀπολύω, used throughout Matthew 19, applies to the divorce of both a conjugal wife and a betrothed wife.[^S-L-1a] Also, πορνεία can describe both fornication and adultery.[^S-L-1b] However, the Pharisees’ question in Matthew 19 does not seem to be limited to betrothal alone. Furthermore, Jesus’ response does not signal any change in the scope of divorce from conjugal wives to betrothed, thus making this view unlikely.

[^S-L-1a]: BDAG, s.v. ἀπολύω.

[^S-L-1b]: Janzen, 42.

Ben Witherington argues that the use of πορνεία in both Matthew 5:32 and 19:9 is limited to illegitimate marriage, namely, incest. Therefore, he interprets the exceptive μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ as permission to divorce marriages that are otherwise illegitimate. Notably, there are other New Testament and apocryphal uses of πορνεία as incest.[^L-P-2a] Furthermore, D. A. Carson presumes the prohibition of remarriage in Deuteronomy 24:4 can be interpreted as a type of incest.[^M-O-1e] Rabbis of the time even interpreted the referenced Genesis texts as forbidding "unnatural and incestuous intercourse," and yet, were allowing proselytes to continue in incestuous relationships.[^M-O-1b] Also, Witherington presumes the incestuous Herod-Herodias affair is in view during the Pharisees’ testing.[^M-O-1d] Finally, Witherington asserts, "It is likely that the rabbis would have understood Jesus to be referring specifically to the discussion about incestuous marriage when he quotes these texts."[^M-O-1c] If Witherington is correct, then interpreting πορνεία as "illegitimate marriage" or "incest" would radically alter the nature of the exceptive clauses in Matthew, effectively permitting divorce for illegitimate marriages, but no others.[^M-O-1a]

[^L-P-2a]: E.g., 1 Cor. 5:1. Witherington, 572.

[^M-O-1e]: Carson, 467.

[^M-O-1d]: Ibid., 572.

[^M-O-1c]: Ibid., 573.

[^M-O-1a]: Ibid., 574.

Finally, James Weibling interprets Matthew 19:9 as a Jewish cultural equivalent to the Gentile reading of Mark 10:11-12.[^M-W-1a] First, Weibling notes that the parallel of Mark 10:11-12 establishes the moral culpability of the spouse initiating the divorce. Then, he interprets Matthew 19:9 similarly, but in light of Jewish divorce codes.[^M-W-1c] Rather than interpreting μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ as permitting the husband to divorce his wife after she has committed adultery, Weibling argues that the Jewish man may innocently divorce when "his wife's behavior indicated she, in essence, had already left him for another. "[^M-W-1b] Because Jewish wives were unable to legally divorce their husbands, this allows a "dejected husband" to legally permit his wife to marry another without himself incurring spiritual culpability. Of the non-exceptive views of μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ, Weibling’s interpretation is unique in that it disallows a spouse from spiritually initiating a divorce but permits the innocent spouse to morally remarry subsequent to the divorce.[^M-W-1d]

# Conclusion

The essence of Matthew 19:1--12 is Jesus’ affirmation of God’s original ideal of the indissolubility of marriage. Although verse 9 increases the difficulty of systematizing a view on divorce and remarriage, Jesus’ affirmed ideal ought to guide one’s interpretation of the entire passage. Consider D. A. Carson’s advice regarding the interpretation of this difficult text:

> Any view of divorce and remarriage (taught in either Testament) that sees the problem only in terms of what may or may not be done has already overlooked a basic fact: divorce is never to be thought of as a God-ordained, morally neutral option but as evidence of sin, of hardness of heart. The fundamental attitude of the Pharisees to the question was wrong.[^C-1a]

[^C-1a]: Carson, 467.

May we not approach this passage in the same manner as the Pharisees, thereby seeking out permission for the dissolution of God-ordained marriages. Rather, in our interpretation of this passage, may we promote Jesus’ affirmation of God’s ideal of life-long monogamous marriage.
