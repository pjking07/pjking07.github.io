*The Barnabas Factors: Eight Essential Practices of Church Planting Team Members*. By J. D. Payne.  CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2012, 176 pp., $9.99 Kindle.

In *The Barnabas Factors*, J. D. Payne looks to the New Testament church-planter, Barnabas, as an exemplary model for church planting team members today. Payne extracts eight factors from the example of Barnabas which he considers essential for planting teams. These factors are outlined from the narratives about Barnabas and are filled in with New Testament exhortations for all Christians. Each of the factors is as follows:

1. *Walks with the Lord*. Payne contends that walking with the Lord is the "foundation upon which the rest of the Barnabas Factors stand" (p. 16). Therefore,  "the team must place a high priority on each member 'walking in the light' as He is in the light" (p. 17).
2. *Maintains an Outstanding Character*. Acts 11:24 describes Barnabas as "good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith." Payne expands on this verse by defining each of the three qualities attributed to Barnabas. Most significantly, the author recognizes that team members must be full of the Holy Spirit, "constantly yield[ing] themselves to the Lord and bear[ing] the fruit of the Spirit in their lives" (pp. 30–31).
3. *Serves the Local Church*. Barnabas and his fellow missionaries were "involved in regular and ongoing fellowship while serving with other believers and churches" (p. 45).
4. *Remains Faithful to the Call*. According to Payne, "When the Lord calls someone, He not only calls that person to a specific task or assignment, but He calls him to an obedient lifestyle," and his obedience requires faithfulness to God, the team, and the Great Commission (p. 63).
5. *Shares the Gospel Regularly*. The author argues, "True missionaries . . . are not content with the planting of churches through transfer growth" (p. 78) and ought to follow Barnabas who "regularly shared the gospel with intentionality, boldness, and tenacity" (p. 72).
6. *Raises Up Leaders*. Payne considers Barnabas' relationship with Paul and affirms that "effective church planting teams consist of individuals who understand the value of multiplication" (p. 84).
7. *Encourages with Speech and Actions*. The author exhorts church planting team members to imitate Barnabas, who by "being filled with the Great Encourager, he was able to build up the Body of Christ for the multiplication of disciples, leaders, and churches" (p. 112).
8. *Responds Appropriately to Conflict*. Payne encourages planting teams to do everything "out of love, for the sake of the Kingdom, as a witness for the Lord, out of a spirit of humility and servanthood, and in seeking the best for the other team members" (pp. 122–123).

Payne's analysis of Barnabas' character and service is helpful in building a model for an excellent church planting team member. The New Testament is clear that Barnabas, the Son of Encouragement, was a blessing to his churches and proved effective in ministry. Unfortunately, the author transforms Barnabas' model into a check-list which the planting team members must have at the "core of their being" (p. 130). This transformation is especially problematic because the author at times seems to arbitrarily add qualities to Barnabas which were not explicitly attributed to him, e.g., Payne's expansion of "good man" and "of faith" in factor #2. Despite these few problems, this book encourages meditation on Barnabas' exemplary qualities, which would prove beneficial to any church planting team member. Rather than holding Barnabas's model as a requirement for team members, perhaps teams should look to his example for encouragement and exhortation in their current ministry. May we all consider ourselves in light of Barnabas' great example.
