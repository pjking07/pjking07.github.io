*The Gospel and Personal Evangelism*. By Mark Dever. Wheaton: Crossway, 2007, 128 pp., $6.59 Kindle. Reviewed by Vernon R. King, III.

# Summary

Mark Dever’s *The Gospel and Personal Evangelism* has a simple purpose: "It is meant to be an encouragement, a clarification, an instruction, a rebuke, and a challenge all rolled up into several short chapters" (p. 16). These chapters each answer a specific question regarding evangelism. Significantly, Dever begins by asking, "Why don’t we evangelize?" After addressing some common excuses, e.g., "other things seem more urgent," Dever discusses a plan to help one "stop not evangelizing." This plan includes twelve steps: "pray, plan, accept, understand, be faithful, risk, prepare, look, love, fear, stop, and consider" (p. 23).

Dever’s next question, "What is the gospel?" ensures his readers "get the news right" (p. 32). He structures this chapter by addressing what the gospel is *not*, i.e., "I’m okay," "God is love," "Jesus is my friend," and "I should live right" (p. 32). After discussing why these are wrong conceptions of the gospel, Dever defines the gospel in contrast to each.

"Who should evangelize?" is Dever’s third question. The author asserts that evangelism is not solely the job of evangelists, but is the job of the entire church (pp. 45, 50). He argues from numerous Scripture passages and ultimately concludes, "We know that God’s intent in establishing the church was to bear witness to himself and to his character. As Paul wrote, ‘His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known’ (Eph. 3:10)" (p. 50).

After establishing that all Christians should evangelize, Dever asks, "How should we evangelize?" In evangelism, Dever wants to strike "a balance of honesty and urgency and joy" (p. 55). Christians must speak honestly of both the need and cost of salvation. One must speak with urgency because there is an expiration date to God’s offer. However, this must all be delivered with joy because "it is all worth it, despite the cost" (p. 58).

Returning to definitions, the author asks, "What isn’t evangelism?" Dever defines evangelism in the same manner he defined the gospel, i.e., by contrasting it to what it is not. Specifically, he contrasts evangelism to imposition, personal testimony, social action, apologetics, and conversion. Rather, "to evangelize is to declare on the authority of God what he has done to save sinners, to warn men of their lost condition, to direct them to repent, and to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ" (p. 80).

Next, Dever asks the important question, "What should we do after we evangelize?" Writing mostly about negative personal responses, Dever reminds his readers, "We can’t force someone to make a decision. . . . But we can be clear about the danger of waiting" (p. 85). Regarding positive responses, Dever encourages discipleship and church membership while attempting to confirm conversion through evidential fruit (p. 91).

Finally, Dever asks, "Why should we evangelize?" He argues that "good motives for evangelism are a desire to be obedient, a love for the lost, and a love for God" (p. 96). Dever then ends the chapter with several encouragements to evangelize, such as meditating on the reality of hell and the gospel and considering the cross and God’s sovereignty.

# Contribution to Evangelism in the Local Church

Mark Dever is known for his focus on the local church, especially through the 9Marks ministry of Capitol Hill Baptist Church. Although evangelism is intensely personal in nature, Dever continues his emphasis on the local church throughout this book. He consistently frames evangelistic duty as belonging both to the church and to the Christian. Quite simply, the church cannot evangelize as an institution if its people are not evangelizing as individuals, yet the church still is responsible to evangelize. Perhaps Dever’s most significant contribution to evangelism in the local church is his insistence that every member participate. To this end, Dever offers practical advice to help churches equip their members for evangelism. By orienting all of its members to preach the good news of Christ, the institutional church can fulfill part of its responsibility to evangelize the lost.

# Author’s Argumentation

Dever structures his arguments around questions and answers. He often mentions his own struggles in personal evangelism, leading the reader to assume Dever has worked through many of these questions himself. Because the book is structured around these major questions, the reader is able to contextually progress through Dever’s argumentation, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the author’s work. As a short, easy-to-read book, *The Gospel and Personal Evangelism* should be profitable for and enjoyed by Christians of many backgrounds, regardless of their current effort and effect in evangelism.

# Key Quotes

> The Christian call to evangelism is a call not simply to persuade people to make decisions but rather to proclaim to them the good news of salvation in Christ, to call them to repentance, and to give God the glory for regeneration and conversion. We don’t fail in our evangelism if we faithfully tell the gospel to someone who is not converted; we fail only if we don’t faithfully tell the gospel at all. Evangelism itself isn’t converting people; it’s telling them that they need to be converted and telling them how they can be. (pp. 81–82)

> This is to be our evangelism: a God-given commission and method, a God-centered message, and a God-centered motive. We should all evangelize. Evangelism isn’t all those other things we considered; it is telling the good news about Jesus, and doing it with honesty, urgency, and joy, using the Bible, living a life that backs it up, and praying, and doing it all for the glory of God. (p. 107)
