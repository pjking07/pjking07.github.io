In his forthcoming book, _Going Public_, Bobby Jamieson constructs an argument for why baptism should be required for church membership. In particular, Jamieson weighs in on the perennial intra-Baptist debate concerning open-membership---that is, should Christians "baptized" only as infants be granted membership into Baptist churches, or must such candidates first be baptized as believers? Jamieson writes, "This whole book aims toward the conclusion that churches should require prospective members to be baptized---which is to say, baptized as believers---in order to join" (1). In fact, the author decided to write a book on this topic because "[open-membership] is a pressing question for many pastors and churches, and I think there's a biblical way to answer it" (10). Through this book, Jamieson rebuilds the "ecclesiological foundations that the acid rain of individualism has burned away" (14). He excels at accomplishing his purpose by constructing a positive theology of baptism while also establishing its relationship to the church, membership, and the Lord's Supper.

_Going Public_ was an absolute pleasure to read for many reasons. The author builds a positive theological argument before dealing with his opponents, whom he treats with utmost Christian love and respect. He maintains focus on the book's thesis by persistently summarizing and reiterating the progression of his argument. His academic research is excellent, and his language is approachable for all types of readers. Hardly what I expected from a monograph covering a narrow, intra-Baptist debate, Jamieson's writing made me want to slow down and absorb his book.

Jamieson argues convincingly for his thesis, namely, that "baptism and the Lord's Supper are effective signs of church membership: they create the social, ecclesial reality to which they point" (5). He uses historical Baptists to show that the debate over open-membership (and similarly, open-communion) is nothing new, and cites modern Baptists to demonstrate that the divide continues to this day. This work is particularly relevant to Southern Baptists because studies show that more than half of SBC churches practice open-communion despite the "close"-communion position of the Baptist Faith and Message, making these churches unable to unreservedly affirm their denomination's confession.

One inconsistency pervades this work, captured in Jamieson's pithy refrain, "no baptism; no church" (72). While Jamieson argues how the institution of baptism constitutes a church and new members are initiated into the local church through baptism, he also maintains that gospel-preaching, paedobaptist churches are _real churches_. While I agree that paedobaptist gatherings are indeed churches, for Jamieson to argue that churches cannot exist without believer's baptism inherently removes the label of "church" from all non-Baptist gatherings. For instance, after affirming, "There is simply no such thing as membership without baptism," Jamieson attempts to explicate his opinion by writing, "Of course, I'm not denying that a church has the ability to extend membership to unbaptized persons. But ability is not authority" (104). The author does recognize this tension and suggests, in a footnote, that paedobaptist churches are churches if they preach the gospel and practice their view of the ordinances. He writes that while those only baptized as infants do not have the authority to form a church, "once they're a church, they're a church" (135, footnote). This tension continues throughout the book; thus, Jamieson's resolution ought to have been elevated from the footnotes and explicated in the text of the book itself.

While the focus of _Going Public_ is open- vs. closed-membership, Jamieson's work necessarily delves into Baptist discussions concerning paedobaptism, open-communion, church membership, and the constitution of a church. As such, this gracious book is a _must read_ for Baptists everywhere, especially those who practice open-membership or open-communion. Readers will be both challenged and edified.
