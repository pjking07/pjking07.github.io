Today was a great day. In the morning, Dr. [Thomas Johnston](http://www.evangelizology.com/) of Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary taught us to unleash the word "evangelize". While the Greek word evangelize is often translated as preach in our English translations, "preach" has a different denotation than "evangelize". This alternative translation of "evangelize" as "preach" puts the gospel "on house arrest within the four walls of the church." Whereas some are called to preach, all are called to evangelize. However, there is no limit on those who ought to evangelize in the church---it is an every member gift and responsibility!

Afterword, Ellis Prince spoke to us about his own experience planting a church in Baltimore. His focus remained on many practical items including an emphasis on taking a break. Ellis emphasized that, regardless of one's view of the Sabbatarian *law*, God ordered this world in such a way that people need regular rest. Therefore, Ellis called on all to take a regular Sabbath, to unplug, and to enjoy life and family.

This evening, my team and I again went door-to-door promoting a neighborhood party for Freedom Church and looking for gospel conversations. Michelle and I teamed up once more and we had many positive interactions with people in this neighborhood. We were able to speak deliberately with 7 different children as they were out on the street. They were excited about the party and the majority of them had a framework for Christian dialogue. Most were able to identify a church that  that their families attended (however often that was). God gave us the opportunity to speak some gospel truths to these kids and also hand them [The Story](http://viewthestory.com/10118) booklets for further reading.

Michelle and I were also able to speak with a number of adults. Edwerta has been attending a church across town most of her life, but lost the ability to drive after a number of strokes; she was encouraged by the possibility of attending a more accessible local church. Another gentleman, Norman, is a former Jehovah's Witness with a lot of pain in his background. Although he was convinced he understood the Scripture, we told him a little about who God is and what he has done through Christ. We further encouraged him to read his Bible, to review The Story, and to seek out the peace of Christ.

Derek answered the door of his friends' house and loved to mess around. After some banter between him and us regarding the neighborhood party, I asked him directly if he knew Jesus. 

He replied, "I've never met him face to face." 

"Would you like to hear about him?" I asked.  

"No, I wouldn't." And he stopped the joking, turned around, and went inside.

We also spoke with Jesse, a working man with a young family who has claimed to have faith for many years. Although he reads his Bible and confesses, "God is in charge of my life," he has never attended church. Thankfully, he had already been feeling convicted about his lack of involvement with a church, especially as his children get older. Michelle and I were given the opportunity to exhort him to unite with a local church, encourage him to walk in the life of God, and to pray for him and his family.

We also met with a number of other individuals. Thankfully, we completed our mapped area before the sun went down. Our team finished the day eating dinner at [Chaps Pit Beef](http://www.chapspitbeef.com) where I purchased an inordinately sized box of chicken tenders.
