# Introduction

Everyone worships. Whether it be toward celebrities, money, nature, ourselves, or gods, we all worship with our hearts, minds, and bodies. Although the Christian knows whom to worship, he may still falter in how he worships. The holy, creator God has chosen to reveal not only himself, but also how we ought to respond to him in worship.  "Worship matters," Bob Kauflin writes, "It matters to God because he is the one ultimately worthy of all worship. It matters to us because worshiping God is the reason for which we were created."[^I-1a] 

[^I-1a]: Bob Kauflin, *Worship Matters: Leading Others to Encounter the Greatness of God*, (Wheaton: Crossway, 2008), 20.

Scripture shows that well-intentioned people can still worship God wrongly. Second Samuel 6 portrays two separate accounts of individuals being punished by God for worshiping him incorrectly.[^I-2a] In 2 Samuel 6:1--8, David and his men carried the ark on a cart instead of on poles as prescribed by God. When the oxen stumbled, Uzzah tried to protect the ark from falling by grabbing hold of it. However, Uzzah died after touching the ark, as God had prohibited anyone from touching it. Then in 2 Samuel 6:16--23, Michal despised David for dancing before the Lord unashamed. Although she articulated her concern for David's honor and modesty, the Lord approved of David's worship and instead left Michal barren. These examples show the importance that God places on proper worship. Uzzah died and Michal was childless because each failed to worship God as he requires. 

God desires sincere and proper worship; therefore, Christians ought to seriously consider the nature and propriety of worship as revealed by God in Scripture. While the Christian has not received laws regarding worship, Scripture has surely revealed its nature. Isaiah’s commissioning provides a helpful model through which the Christian can better understand and practice both a corporate and personal life of worship. Even the whole of the corporate worship gathering can be structured around this model from Isaiah.

# A Model from Isaiah[^A-0a]

[^A-0a]: I am indebted to Church of Christ the King in Fort Worth, TX for teaching and practicing an Isaiah 6 model.

A holistic model for Christian worship can be discerned from Isaiah's commissioning. Isaiah 6:1--9a[^A-1a] reads: 

[^A-1a]: Unless otherwise noted, all Scripture references are from the ESV.

> (1) In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. (2) Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. (3) And one called to another and said:

> “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!”

> (4) And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. (5) And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”

> (6) Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. (7) And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”

> (8) And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.” (9) And he said, “Go..."

In this passage, God reveals himself while the angels who know him in perfection praise him. Isaiah responds by humbling himself and confessing his sin, but is assured of his atonement. Then, the Word of the Lord is proclaimed, Isaiah responds to God, and he is sent out on mission. The flow of Isaiah 6 beautifully patterns the Christian life and serves well as a model for Christian worship. Such flow is important to a church gathering because "a clear and connected progression of thought helps people fully benefit from our time together."[^A-3a]

[^A-3a]: Kauflin, 114.

## Revelation

"I saw the Lord," writes Isaiah in verse 1. All our worship ought to begin with God's revelation of himself to his people, for "long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son" (Hebrew 1:1--2a). The Gospels "were written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (John 20:31). Indeed, "all Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness" (2 Timothy 3:16). God has definitively revealed himself to us in this day through the Scripture that we have received. Therefore, we ought to begin our worship gatherings with the revelation of Scripture and continue to read, meditate upon, recite, and sing God's written Word throughout the gathering just as the whole of Isaiah's vision is sustained by the revelation of God. Without Scripture guiding our worship, we are sure to go astray in both orthodoxy and orthopraxy and find ourselves in danger of displeasing our holy and righteous God.

## Response

When one comes before God's presence, two responses are merited: praising God as do the angels or humbling oneself in confession before the perfect Lord. In Isaiah 6, the heavenly seraphim praise God, singing, "Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" (v. 3). In response both to God's presence and the angelic praise, Isaiah proclaims, "Woe is me! For I am lost" (v. 5). Both of these responses to God's revelation should be present in a Christian worship gathering, but the proper order is debatable: Should one confess prior to praising God, or does praise bring about proper confession? For the sake of brevity, this paper will assume the order as presented in Isaiah 6, with adoration preceding confession.

### Adoration

God's revelation of himself to mere humans ought to engender our utmost affections toward him. Indeed, Scripture is filled with praise to God. Psalm 95 exhorts, "Oh come, let us sing to the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!" During this time of praise, the church should use joyful prayer, readings, and songs to show our great adoration for our God and King. Our tone, words, and bodies should all communicate our love for the God of the Universe who chose to adopt us as his children. We ought to focus on his perfect attributes and the extreme pleasure we enjoy in knowing him.

### Confession

Our focus on God's perfect attributes ought to make us aware of our own imperfections.[^A-R-C-1a] Within a church gathering, we have the opportunity to somberly reflect upon our sin and failings before our holy God. With every passing week we can be reminded both of our persistent sinfulness and our continued growth in sanctification. A time of confession can include sung dirges, read laments, or corporately confessed sin through prayer. For churches allowing freedom of movement, this also can be an excellent time to privately confess sin to one another (James 5:16) or to seek forgiveness from those who have been wronged (Matthew 5:23--24). Ultimately, the time of confession ought to remind the Christian of his continued dependence upon God's good grace, "for by a single offering [Christ] has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified" (Hebrews 10:14).

[^A-R-C-1a]: Unfortunately, the act of corporate confession is sorely lacking in many churches today, especially in those observing a revivalistic model.

### Atonement

Following Isaiah's confession, one of the seraphim brought a coal from the altar, touched Isaiah's lips, and declared, "Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for" (Isaiah 6:7). When the Christian church corporately confesses its sin, it ought then to remember that it is "through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement" (Romans 5:11 [KJV]). Remembering one's reconciliation through Christ ought to be both a great joy and relief for the Christian, for by his sacrifice, God "will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more" (Hebrews 10:17). Therefore, the worship gathering should not only include the proclamation of Christ's reconciliatory work on our behalf, but also allow a time of thanksgiving for all who believe.

Because the act of baptism identifies a believer with Christ and his church through reconciliation, this ordinance fits well following the declaration of Christ's atoning work. Consider how strong the symbolic message of baptism would be when practiced within this progression of worship. Furthermore, the church would be blessed to have an anticipation of frequent baptisms into the church, demonstrating new belief and acceptance of Christ's atoning work. May the church return to an expectation for the Lord to add to its number daily (Acts 2:47). For churches that baptize outside of regular worship meetings (whether due to facilities or conviction) baptisms could still be part of an off-site worship gathering following the Isaiah 6 model or could simply take place immediately following the regular gathering.

## Proclamation

Following the angel's proclamation of atonement, Isaiah "heard the voice of the Lord" (Isaiah 6:8). Christians must continually return to the voice of the Lord, primarily through the revelation of Scripture. This time of proclamation can center around a sermon, but it could also resemble 1 Corinthians 14 in which Paul allows two or three to give a prophetic word and two or three to offer interpreted tongues. Songs and prayers proclaiming the Word of God would also be appropriate. The focus of this time should not be on anyone's oratorical skills, funny stories, or topical teachings disjointed from Scripture. Instead, proclamation should allow the congregation to ruminate on God's Holy Word so that it can be applied to the life of the Christian and the church. 

While enough time should be given to this portion of the gathering so that the Spirit can communicate what he desires to the Body of Christ, the worship gathering should not culminate with the proclamation, as that privilege should be given to the Lord's Supper. Instead, this time of proclamation should prepare the church to corporately meet with Christ through Communion. Proclamation is not an end; it is a means to knowing Christ intimately as his body.

## Dedication

After the Lord asked "Whom shall I send?", Isaiah responds, "Here I am! Send me" (Isaiah 6:8). The Lord spoke and Isaiah responded; the time of dedication is the church's opportunity to respond to the proclamation of God's Word by his Spirit. Dedication can be emphasized with appropriate songs, prayers, or Scripture readings. This is also an excellent opportunity for the church to recite together a doctrinal statement or the church covenant. The time of dedication can also include responses such as prayer and supplication, collecting an offering, and observing the Lord's Supper. The church should "draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith" because "we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh" (Hebrews 10:19--22).

For many reasons, the Lord's Supper ought to be the culmination of the corporate gathering. Christ ordained the Supper so that we would remember his suffering on our account. It is also an opportunity for the church to commune together with Christ, who is spiritually present in his Supper. Furthermore, the Supper was the primary focus of early Christian worship, even before the development of sacramental theology.

If communion is observed during a worship gathering, it would be partaken best during the time of dedication. Just as baptism allows one to identify with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection, communion allows the church to identify with Christ's suffering as his Body. This identification with suffering is necessary because the church must "suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him" (Romans 8:17). However, this is not a time of mourning or lament; it is a time to "rejoice insofar as you share Christ’s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed" (1 Peter 4:13).

While the time of dedication is ideal for those observing communion within a regular church gathering, the Lord's Supper ought truly be a *supper*. In Paul's critique of the Corinthian church, he writes, "When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat. For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own *meal*" (1 Corinthians 11:20--21, emphasis added). Furthermore, having a Lord's *Supper* allows for a profitable time of fellowship for the members of the church. Having a separate supper also encourages church discipline, making it easier to bar the unrepentant from the table. Consider the depth of a worship gathering that culminates not in a little bread and wine, but with a love meal filled with regenerate members of the church. Such an observance would elevate the corporate nature of our identification with our Lord Jesus. Even the church that finds it impractical to have a meal should contemplate, "How can we modify the way in which we have the Lord's Supper to give greater expression to the fact that we meet as the body of Christ?"[^A-D-C-3a]

## Commission

Once Isaiah dedicates himself, the Lord responds, "Go..." and commissions Isaiah to a specific work. After the church has dedicated itself once more to the Lord through offerings, communion, and word, the gathering ought to conclude with a commissioning of the church to live in light of the risen Savior. This would also be an appropriate time to specifically commission those who have a task set before them, whether mission trips, calls to ministry, or some other work from the Lord. It would also be appropriate to remind the whole church of its commission before the Lord, to be his "witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth" (Acts 1:8).

# Conclusion

While Isaiah's commissioning is not the only model for Christian worship to be found in Scripture,[^C-1a] it is commendable for its depth and progression. Following the categories found in Isaiah 6 allows the church to worship God by orienting the gathering around him and his revelation, while remembering all he has done for the saints by the sacrifice and resurrection of Christ. However, the Christian must always remember that the conclusion of a worship gathering is not the end of one's worship. May we all remember to live in a spiritual act of worship, presenting our bodies as holy, acceptable, and living sacrifices, being transformed by the renewal of our minds so that we may discern the will of God (Romans 12:1--2).
