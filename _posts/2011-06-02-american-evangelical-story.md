What does it mean to be an evangelical? This question is the
starting point for Douglas A. Sweeney, Ph.D., (Vanderbilt University) in
his concise look at the movement in _The American Evangelical
Story_. Although Sweeney does attempt to define the movement, his
work focuses more on a brief history of evangelicalism. Sweeney paints a
broad picture of the evangelical movement, and does so in accessible
language, while providing a number of useful details. Sweeney succeeds
in his goal of testifying to the breadth of evangelicalism, and the
Church's continued need for the movement today.


Summary
=======

Sweeney notes that defining the evangelical movement is difficult, but
attempts it nonetheless, suggesting that "evangelicals are a movement of
orthodox Protestants with an eighteenth-century twist" (24). From there,
he explains the *eighteenth-century twist* came in the form of the first
and second Great Awakenings, because with them came immense changes in
how Christianity was spread and practiced. Sweeney goes on to describe
how, as evangelicalism was sweeping (and saturating) America, a breakout
in foreign missions occurred, bringing about cross-cultural
evangelization on an unprecedented scale. He proceeds to trace the
movement forward through history.

The final chapters of the book, rather than being chronological in
nature, each discuss a particular theme in the history of
evangelicalism: the rise in missions (as mentioned above), the successes
and failures of black and white race relations, the holiness and
Pentecostal movements, and the evangelical sub-movements of
fundamentalism and neoevangelicalism. These chapters effectively depict
the full breadth of the evangelical landscape.


Critical Evaluation
===================

In his first chapter, "Evangelical: What's in a Word?" Sweeney does a fine
job of describing the difficulty of precisely defining the term
evangelical. It was only in reflection upon that difficulty that I began
to appreciate his definition.[^1] Indeed, his insight solidified in
my mind when he described evangelical *beliefs* as being rooted in the
Protestant Reformation, while evangelical *practices* are rooted in the
Great Awakening. Likewise, I found it intriguing when Sweeney stated
that evangelicalism is America's folk religion. I would have appreciated
his comments on the implications of this assertion, including the
pervasive nature of evangelicalism across the US (especially
historically) and the modern, secular view of evangelicals being stuck
in bygone ways.

Within "A Surprising Work of God: The Eighteenth-Century Revival," the
second chapter, Sweeney begins to explore the historical beginnings of
the evangelical movement. Although the Great Awakening is commonly known
as a revival across the Western world, the side-effects of the first
Awakening were its real legacy. By producing an interdenominational and
pan-geographical movement, the revival gave evangelicalism the
opportunity to become a lasting institution rather than a passing phase.
Sweeney provides an excellent summary of the causes and events of the
Great Awakening. His description of British Puritanism, Continental
Pietism, and other precursors to the Awakening provided a succinct
context for the movement. Furthermore, his focus on the major players of
the Great Awakening (Whitefield, Wesley, and Edwards) aided in the flow
of the chapter.

For the third chapter, "Crafting New Wineskins: Institutionalizing the
Movement," Sweeney turned to the second Great Awakening and the great
revivalists (especially Charles Finney). Whatever his personal opinions,
I appreciated that Sweeney even-handedly acknowledged the role and
influence that women had in evangelicalism during this time. Similarly,
I appreciated the author's distinction that the first Awakening was
largely Calvinistic while the second was largely Arminian. Given the
nature of those two camps, I now more appreciate the practical
differences between the two Awakenings. Of course, following both
Awakenings (as with all revivals) was a decline in the faith. Of
particular interest is Sweeney's note that the revive, decline cycle in
evangelicalism has created a host of schismatic groups, each of which
originally split in order to bring about enhanced growth. Indeed, it
seems that evangelicalism still functions in that cyclical, schismatic
manner.

Sweeney addresses one of my personal passions in his fourth chapter, "As
the Waters Cover the Sea: The Rise of Evangelical Missions." It was good
to read about the history of missions as a stark reminder that we are
not the first generation to care about cross-cultural evangelism and
church planting. Sweeney's discussion of the preliminary work of the
Moravians as well as the efforts of Jonathan Edwards and David Brainerd
offered a broad, accurate picture of the early evangelical missions
movement. However, the author was careful to remember the failings of
evangelical missionary work, such as the exporting of American culture
as part of Christianity. Worse still was the drive toward liberal
missions, with its abandonment of the gospel in favor of social
programs. Sweeney produced a helpful summary of the history of
evangelical missions, while also describing the uniqueness of that
movement within the universal Church.

Controversy is the word-of-the-day in Sweeney's fifth chapter, "Crossing
the Color Line without Working to Erase It: Evangelical History in Black
and White," in which the author shows an honest, striking view of race
relations throughout American Christianity and the evangelical movement.
It was saddening to be reminded of the realities of slavery and its
effects on the evangelization of the slaves themselves. Many slaves were
not permitted to hear evangelism because it might make them "uppity,"
and the slaves who were Christianized were not taught about the exile,
and then exodus, of the Jews. The purging of blacks from the churches
created an evangelical segregation that has never recovered. Indeed, one
of Sweeney's most striking pieces of information is that only 5.5% of
today's churches are interracial! However, I am thankful for the
work the author did in summarizing the black movement in Western
Christianity and the great things that movement has done. With all the
historical overtones of evangelical racism and segregation, it is easy
to understand why most members of the Black Church would not call
themselves evangelical, even though their movement is essentially
evangelical in beliefs and practice.

The groups described in chapter 6, "In Search of a Higher Christian Life:
The Holiness, Pentecostal, and Charismatic Movements," are groups that I
was not originally quick to identify as evangelicals. However, Sweeney
made an excellent argument, rooted in history, that the Pentecostal and
charismatic movements are actually sub-movements within the larger
context of evangelicalism. Their predecessor, the holiness movement, has
widely known beginnings with many evangelicals, including Wesley,
Whitefield, and Finney. From this holiness movement came a charismatic
movement, which was introduced to the world through the Azusa Street
Revival. By the numbers, the charismatic movement is the largest in
evangelicalism, far exceeding any other sub-group. Sweeney's work has
helped me to appreciate the scope and nature of the charismatic
movement.

In his final chapter, "Standing on the Promises through Howling Storms of
Doubt: Fundamentalism and Neoevangelicalism," Sweeney primarily focused
on the historical context of fundamentalism. I was shocked to learn
that the fundamentalist movement was actually, at one time, a proper
Christian movement with *theological*, rather than *cultural*,
distinctives. The movement was not merely a cultural reaction to
creeping evangelical liberalism, but was an assertion of historical,
orthodox Christianity. Sadly, the movement we know of today as
fundamentalism is a far cry from its founding vision, holding on to a
distant, cultural idealism more than biblical truth. In fact, the
neoevangelical movement actually was a schism from fundamentalism,
because that group desired to maintain its orthodox values while
re-engaging the culture and attacking the social ailments of the day.
Billy Graham, Carl Henry, and Charles Fuller were all leaders of this
new evangelical movement. Sweeney's work in this chapter has helped me
to realize that, personally, not only am I an evangelical, I am a
neoevangelical.

Conclusion
==========

In his book, *The American Evangelical Story*, Douglas Sweeney has
provided an approachable, even-handed account of the history of
evangelicalism. Most importantly, the author does not dwell too heavily
on any particular theme, but serves his readers well by summarizing the
major groups of evangelicalism. To my great benefit, this book
purposefully included the less well-known aspects of evangelicalism,
such as the Black Church, the charismatic movement, and the
fundamentalist movement. Reading Sweeney's work has allowed me to expand
my former definition of evangelicalism[^2] to include the *entire*
movement, rather than only my niche. It is with great care that Sweeney
offers this look at a history of the evangelical movement so that we can
know where it has been, and, hopefully, where it is going.

[^1]: As noted above, Sweeney defines the movement thus: "evangelicals are a movement of orthodox Protestants with an eighteenth-century twist" (24).

[^2]: I now know my original view of evangelicalism only included *neoevangelicals*.
