The role of the Holy Spirit with believers radically changed at Pentecost, when the Spirit came to indwell the early disciples of Jesus. From this point on, all who believe in the Lord Jesus receive the indwelling Spirit as a seal for the future and power for today. However, the faithful Jews living for generations prior to Pentecost and the Incarnation were not privileged to live with the indwelling of the Spirit. Considering the inception of the indwelling Spirit at Pentecost, one may wonder, what role does the Holy Spirit play in Christian formation?

Although Jews were at times filled with the Spirit in order to perform a certain work, their typical lives lacked the presence of the Holy Spirit. Lacking the indwelling of God, the Jews consistently showed their own inability to foster spiritual formation in themselves. As one familiar with Jewish history knows, the people of Israel hardly remained faithful to the one true God. The book of Judges shows this most acutely for it repeats many cycles of the Jews turning to God, falling into sin, being punished for their sin, then repenting and turning to God once more. Indeed, each cycle of turning to and from God led Israel deeper and deeper into sin. Furthermore, we know that individual Jews typically failed to live a righteous life before God. Solomon, who was granted the wisdom of God, eventually let his own lust for hundreds of women separate himself from the very source of wisdom. Even David, who is known for being a man after God's own heart, fell into many types of egregious sin at different times.

In stark contrast to the Jewish cycle of apostasy and repentance, the Christian life is one in which we are called to walk a narrow path, never turning from side to side. Although no Christian successfully flees from all sin, the spiritual life of the Christian is distinctly different than what can be observed from Jewish history. The cause of this drastic change is the presence of the indwelling Spirit in Christians. Indeed, the contrast in spiritual formation between the Jews of the Old Testament and Christians demonstrates much of the role the Spirit plays in our sanctification. Jewish history shows us that, without the Spirit, we humans have no ability to progress in sanctification. Like the Jews, we have faith, but unlike the Jews, we have the persistent presence of God empowering us to walk the path laid before us.

When we believe the gospel message, the Spirit enters us and lives within us as a guarantee of our salvation. As that guarantee, the Holy Spirit also plays the explicit and necessary role of completing the work of our Christian formation. The Spirit brings about our sanctification and enables us to follow God. The Spirit guides us, speaks to us, enables us, empowers us, and unites us with God through Christ Jesus. Christians are to live by faith and walk by the Spirit. In spiritual formation, the Word of God is the sword of the Spirit by which we are able to attack our spiritual enemies (Eph. 6:17). Furthermore, Christians are to pray "at all times in the Spirit, . . . making supplication for all the saints" that others may boldly proclaim the gospel (Eph. 6:18--19).

The Holy Spirit unites us with God and empowers us mere mortals to live godly lives in light of the gospel of grace. By this Spirit, we are able to do all that God has prepared for us in this life. What a privilege we Christians have to be indwelt by God himself, by his Spirit.
