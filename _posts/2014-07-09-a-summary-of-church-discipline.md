"A Summary of Church Discipline: Shewing the Qualifications and Duties of the Officers and Members of a Gospel Church" was a document published by the Baptist Association of Charleston, South Carolina in 1774. The summary was "designed chiefly for the benefit of the poor and unlearned" and claimed to be written in "the plainest language" (p. 117). However, this document is not concerned with church discipline in the narrow sense, but in establishing expectations for ministers and members within local churches.

In particular, this document includes chapters on the topics of A True and Orderly Gospel Church, Church Officers, Receiving Persons to Church Membership, The Duties Incumbent on Church Members, Church Censures, and Association of Churches. The summary is written in a tone clearly intending to edify and encourage churches to order themselves biblically; the paragraphs are filled with references to scriptural support for the espoused positions. Even regarding topics such as church discipline, this document is written in love with the expectation of the churches to demonstrate love toward others. Indeed, the document explains church discipline as that which is loving and good for both the church and the unrepentant.

While the language utilized in this document is far beyond what we might consider appropriate for the "poor and unlearned" today, this type of document would be immensely beneficial for today's gospel churches. Today's baptistic church health movement is seeking a return to biblical practices from our forbears, such as those found in this summary. Outside of a few dated references and practices, a gospel church seeking ecclesiastic health could easily utilize this summary. Indeed, many churches would greatly benefit from their ministers, deacons, and members being exposed to this historic summary of church practices.
