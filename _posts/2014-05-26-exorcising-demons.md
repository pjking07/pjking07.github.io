# Introduction

Warfare dominates the spiritual state of this world (cf. Eph. 6:10--20).[^i-1] Ever since being cast out of heaven, Satan and his demons have fomented wrath-filled war "on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus" (Rev. 12:7--17).[^i-2] While the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ inaugurated the eternal victory of God over the powers of Satan, spiritual skirmishes shall remain until Satan, his demons, and all the wicked are cast into the Lake of Fire (Rev. 20:7--20). Spiritual activity in the Christian era includes personal communion with God through the indwelling Spirit and personal attacks from Satan through his multitude of demons, including the possession of individuals. Demons today continue to torment and control individuals through demonization just as they did in the New Testament; as a result, the Church must continue the biblical practice of exorcism.[^i-3]

[^i-3]: In this paper, the term "demonization" is inclusive of both demonic possession and oppression. The term "exorcism" describes the type of deliverance ministry depicted in the New Testament, rather than any particular instantiation of the practice today. For more discussion on these terms, see Page, 138; Karl Payne, *Spiritual Warfare: Christians, Demonization, and Deliverance* (Washington, D.C.: WND, 2011), 112--118; James M. Collins, *Exorcism and Deliverance Ministry in the Twentieth Century* (Colorado Springs: Paternoster, 2009), 4; Victor Knowles, *Angels and Demons* (Joplin, MO: College Press, 1994), 347.

# Spiritual Warfare in the New Testament

The New Testament records multiple accounts of demonized individuals.[^swnt-1] This exhibition of demonic power in personal lives included expressions of illness, superhuman strength, and even divination (Luke 13:11, 8:27-38; Acts 16:16-20). No character of the New Testament appeared surprised by demonization; instead, the crowds were astonished that Jesus and his followers had the authority and power cast out the problematic demons (cf. Luke 4:36). In response to the presentation of the victims of demonization, the Lord Jesus and his disciples consistently confronted and cast out demons through exorcism, thus healing many individuals.[^swnt-2]

## Demons vs. Jesus

From the beginning of his ministry, Jesus healed the sick, the ill, and the demonized (Mark 1:32). The crowds recognized Jesus' power and thereby brought the ailing to him for healing and exorcism. In this, Jesus did not typically seek out the demonic; rather, demonized individuals or their family came directly to him (cf. Matt. 15:22; Mark 7:25; Luke 6:18).[^dvj-1-1] In response, Jesus showed his authority over darkness and cast such demons out of their personal habitats.

[^dvj-1-1]: Page, 140.

While most accounts of Jesus' exorcisms were benign, some demons caused quite a scene. In the Gerasenes, two men lived among the tombs and were unable to be restrained by chains or shackles, for they were possessed by a legion of demons (Mark 5:1-14; Luke 8:29). As Jesus was passing by, these demonized men came out to confront Jesus, crying loudly, "What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?" (Matt. 8:29). Despite the physical strength at their disposal, these demons presented themselves to Jesus, recognized his authority, begged not to be tormented, and then left their victims as soon as Jesus said, "Go" (Matt. 8:28--32; cf. Mark 5:13). Thus, Jesus demonstrated power and authority over any number and all types of demons, despite their apparent spiritual power or physical strength.[^dvj-2-1]

[^dvj-2-1]: Ibid., 150.

Although Jesus' authority over the demonic was unquestioned by the very demons he cast out, the Pharisees persisted in their own doubts.[^dvj-3-1] When the Pharisees suggested that Jesus' power over demons came from Beelzebul, "the prince of demons," Jesus responded that he cast out demons by the Spirit of God, revealing, "the kingdom of God has come upon you" (Matt. 12:22--28). Significantly, Jesus vanquished demons by the effectual Spirit of God, who is the same Spirit whom all Christians have indwelling.

[^dvj-3-1]: Ibid., 173.

## Demons vs. the Disciples

Just as Jesus exorcized demons by the Spirit of God, the apostles and disciples of Jesus cast out demons by the same Spirit.[^dvd-1-0] Before sending the original twelve apostles out on an early mission, Jesus "gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction" (Matt. 10:1). Jesus sent out 72 disciples on a similar mission; upon their return, the disciples exclaimed, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!" (Luke 10:17). By the Spirit, Jesus gave the apostles and disciples authority "over all the power of the enemy" (Luke 10:19).[^dvd-1-1] Continuing into Acts, the apostles and disciples persisted in their authority over demons (cf. Acts 5:16, 8:7, 19:12--20).

[^dvd-1-0]: Knowles, 280; Page, 174.

[^dvd-1-1]: Page, 169. 

Although the apostles shared in the authority of Jesus, by the Spirit, they did not necessarily have full access to this power at all times. In one instance, the apostles failed to heal a demonized child. After exorcizing the demon himself, Jesus taught that the apostles failed because of their little faith and lack of prayer (Matt. 17:14--20; Mark 9:29). Although the apostles could share in Jesus' power, they had to exercise both faith and prayer in order to exorcize all demons.

Some who were not part of the identifiable group of Jesus' disciples were successfully casting out demons in the name of Jesus. Although the apostle John was concerned about this, Jesus responded, "Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me" (Mark 9:39; cf. Luke 9:49). However, one's ability to seemingly cast out demons in the name of Jesus is not sufficient evidence of one's salvation; at the judgment, many will be declared to be workers of lawlessness even though they prophesied, cast out demons, and did mighty works in the name of Jesus (Matt. 7:22--23). 

However, the name of Jesus cannot be used to exorcize demons as a mere magical incantation, but must be exercised in faith with prayer (cf. Matt. 17:14--20; Mark 9:29; Acts 19:14--16).[^dvd-3-0] "Only disciples can overcome the inevitable spiritual battles that all of us face."[^dvd-3-1] Even after the scattering of the faithful, a regular disciple, Philip the Evangelist, cast out demons and healed the lame (Acts 8:7).[^dvd-3-2] The authority over demons given to the 12 apostles and the 72 disciples has been extended explicitly in the commission to all who believe (Mark 16:17). Therefore, the power over demons through exorcism is available to all Christians today.

# Spiritual Warfare Today

Paul writes, "Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil" (Eph. 6:10--11). With defensive armor and offensive weapons, discipled Christians are to engage in spiritual warfare against the rulers, authorities, cosmic powers, and the spiritual forces of evil (Eph. 6:12).[^swt-1] Although spiritual warfare has a much greater scope than exorcizing demons,[^swt-2] Christians must recognize and engage in the battles occurring on this front.

## Recognize the War

The enemy of this world is working to destroy men through spiritual warfare (1 Pet. 5:8). However, "the reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil" (1 John 3:8). Although the Son's Incarnation and his work at Golgotha inaugurated the victory over the forces of darkness, Satan and his demons continue to wage war on all who follow Jesus. Just as in the New Testament, one of the tools used today on the demonic front continues to be the demonization of individual persons.[^rw-1-1] Therefore, the Church today must continue to combat demonization with the spiritual weapons of faith, prayer, and exorcism.[^rw-1-2] 

[^rw-1-1]: Ibid., 62.

[^rw-1-2]: Ibid.

Christians ought to strive to identify the work of demons. Because wickedness exists through the sources of the world, the flesh, and the devil,[^rw-2-1] Christians must consider demonic activity and demonization as a potential source of evil. Within western society, demons appear to possess and torment victims in such a way that they are not often identified and exorcised.[^rw-2-2] Therefore, Christians must be diligent to discern demonic activity in themselves and others.

[^rw-2-1]: Page, 188.

[^rw-2-2]: Cristiani, 70.

Furthermore, Christians must correctly discern between the work of the enemy and the work of God.[^rw-3-1] For this reason, one of the gifts of the Spirit is "the ability to distinguish between spirits" (1 Cor. 12:10). Characters in the Gospels even misattributed the works of Jesus as being powered by the demonic; such misattribution is closely associated with "the blasphemy against the Spirit [that] will not be forgiven" (Matt. 12:31; cf. Matt. 12:22--28, John 8:48). Therefore, Christians ought to be careful in discerning between spirits.

[^rw-3-1]: Knowles, 313.

## Exorcism as Apologetic

The aim of Christians in spiritual warfare is both healing and conversion. Jesus healed people and exorcised demons to give authority to his testimony that "everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name" (Acts 10:43). The early church father, Athanasius, even made use of contemporary exorcisms as an apologetic for the power of God in Christ.[^ec-1-1] Exorcisms in the name of Christ, by the Spirit, attest to the power of Christ for salvation (cf. Mark 1:27, Luke 4:36).

[^ec-1-1]: Athanasius *On the Incarnation* 48.

Unfortunately, those who are healed of demons do not necessarily receive the indwelling Holy Spirit by faith. Jesus warned against this end; if demons are exorcized, but the victim does not respond in faith, then the victim may be re-possessed by more demons, leaving that person in a worse state (Luke 11:26).[^ec-2-1] As L. Cristiani writes, "one of the most urgent tasks of the exorcist is not only to 'cure' the possessed person, but also to lead him towards sanctity."[^ec-2-2]

[^ec-2-1]: Cf. Cristiani, 63; Page, 172.

[^ec-2-2]: Cristiani, 72.

After the man of the Gerasenes was healed of his demons, Jesus commanded him, "Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you" (Luke 8:38). Because of this man's testimony of exorcism and conversion, everyone in the Decapolis marveled (Mark 5:20). Similarly, Christians ought to use exorcism as a tool for the proclamation of the gospel and an apologetic for the power of God (cf. Luke 10:20).[^ec-3-1] However, such a focus on gospel proclamation will likely entice Satan to even greater spiritual battles, because "the Enemy always fights against believers who obey the Great Commission."[^ec-3-2]

# Anti-War Protests

Despite the evidence presented above, some self-identifying Christians disagree that demonization and exorcism are components of spiritual warfare in the church age. John Nevius, an advocate for the practice of exorcism, lists multiple views that diverge from the practice of exorcism in the New Testament or today.[^awp-1-1] Three views will be discussed in brief.

[^awp-1-1]: John L. Nevius, *Demon Possession* (Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1968), 245--254.

First, some propose that the New Testament characters represented the primitive thought of the day and merely misattributed ailments to demons.[^awp-2-1] Henry Kelly argues that demonization is unlikely because "the notion that certain deranged persons are possessed by a spirit is an extremely crude medical theory widespread among primitive peoples."[^awp-2-2] Kelly is even skeptical of supposedly successful exorcisms, arguing that exorcisms are merely psychological placebos.[^awp-2-3] However, Sydney Page argues, "The simple fact of the matter is that the question of the existence of incorporeal beings cannot be proved or disproved by scientific methods."[^awp-2-4] Because scientific methods are inadequate for determining spiritual reality, Christians ought to be discerning while identifying potential sources for any person's condition.[^awp-2-5] As Cristiani writes, it is permissible to believe in "the facts of possession without incurring a reproof from the most exacting of sciences."[^awp-2-6] 

[^awp-2-1]: Nevius, 245.

[^awp-2-2]: Henry Ansgar Kelly, *The Devil, Demonology and Witchcraft* (Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Co., 1968), 91.

[^awp-2-4]: Page, 268.

[^awp-2-5]: Ibid., 180.

[^awp-2-6]: Cristiani, 157.

Second, some suppose that Jesus did not believe in demonic superstition; rather, he condescended his language for the sake of his audience.[^awp-3-1] Similarly, Cortés and Gatti wrote *The Case against Possessions and Exorcisms* in order to make the Gospel narratives more believable by removing prescientific beliefs concerning demonization. They argue that no one in the New Testament was actually possessed by the Devil or demons, nor were there any actual exorcisms.[^awp-3-2] Although this view attempts to maintain the intellectual integrity of Jesus, it damages the truthfulness of the Son of God,[^awp-3-3] whose own identity and authority was substantiated by miracles, including exorcisms.[^awp-3-4] Following Jesus' first exorcism in Mark, the people exclaimed, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him" (Mark 1:27). If Jesus was not truly performing exorcisms, but merely acted as if he were doing so, then he partially based his projected authority upon a lie.

[^awp-3-1]: Nevius, 246.

[^awp-3-2]: Juan B. Cortés and Florence M. Gatti, *The Case against Possessions and Exorcisms* (New York: Vantage, 1975), 1--2.

[^awp-3-3]: Nevius, 247.

[^awp-3-4]: Ibid., 248.

Third, some contend that demonization no longer happens in the church age, even though it did in apostolic times.[^awp-4-1] However, Jesus' commissioning of the apostles and disciples reveals that, in the church age, spiritual warfare continues through possession and exorcism, just as it did in the book of Acts (cf. Mark 16:17, Acts 8:7). Offering a similar divergent view, Victor Knowles argues that Christians today should not exorcize demons, even though demonization continues. According to his view, the demonized ought to be delivered from demons only through faith conversion and by the indwelling of the Spirit.[^awp-4-2] While conversion and the indwelling of the Spirit can cast out demons, exorcism is still necessary, especially for individuals whose own personality has been lost to demonic forces, e.g., the man of the Gerasenes.

[^awp-4-1]: Ibid., 249.

[^awp-4-2]: Knowles, 353.

By denying the existence of the enemy or ignoring his powers and tactics, Christians may allow the enemy to advance unopposed, thus damaging the war effort. For certain degrees of demonization, modern victims are too often counted as insane by both society and the Church and are thus ignored, incarcerated, or institutionalized.[^aw-3] Rather than avoiding or ignoring spiritual battles against the demonic, Christians should prepare for war by putting on the armor of God and battle Satan and his demons with every weapon and shield available.

[^aw-3]: Cf. Cristiani, 70.

# Conclusion

Demons today continue to torment and control individuals through demonization just as they did in the New Testament; as a result, the Church must continue the biblical practice of exorcism. Although the presence and work of the demonic conflicts with assumptions in certain world-views,[^c-1] the Church needs to recognize the spiritual battlefield of this world and respond to attacks in kind. Just as Jesus exorcized demons, he gave the same authority to all who believe in him. For one who hesitated to recognize the authority of the name of Jesus over all demonic activity, Jesus said, "All things are possible for one who believes." May the Church respond in kind with the man who thus cried out, "I believe; help my unbelief!" (Mark 9:22--24). The Church must have faith in Jesus and his authority, put on the full armor of God, identify the spiritual battles in this world, and fight the Enemy as his minions present themselves.
