On Memorial Day weekend my family and I were traveling to Washington D.C. to enjoy a break from the stresses of home, especially while we had help from my wonderful sister-in-law. After traveling a few hours (which is always a joy with 4 children) we stopped for dinner at Wendy's. Seth needed to feed, so he and Katie stayed in the car while I took Hannah and the kids into the "restaurant." As always, managing the chaos was "fun" and we had to stay extra-long because Seth was apparently a hungry bear. Oh, and this was after me trying to order gluten-free food at Wendy's. Awesome. Suffice it to say, I was pretty exhausted and tired of being in that blasted place when Seth finally finished and we were able to get back on the road. Woohoo. It was in that moment, as we were packing up, that a gentleman walked up to me and directly asked, "Could you please buy a meal for me?" In my tiredness, selfishness, and hardness of heart, I said, "No, It's time for us to go; we are leaving."

Busted.

Being so used to beggars asking for *money* so that they can buy that which pleases them, I had developed an automatic response to those seeking handouts: "No." However, this man didn't ask for money. There was nothing of impropriety he could do with my generosity. He asked me for a meal. He asked if I could feed him. He was *hungry*. And I said, "*No*".

After we were well on our way, God convicted me. hard. And he has continued to convict me of this sin. In my tiredness and hurriedness, I denied a meal to a man who was hungry. A man standing right in front of me. I thought I was justifying myself when I lumped him in with everyone who seeks out cash to fuel their addictions. I clearly failed to recognize that he was seeking a meal to fuel his body. I failed this man; I failed Christ.

Have you heard of the story of the goats and the sheep? This story is perhaps the most frightening passage for the Christian. According to Jesus:

> “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.

> “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’

> “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’

> “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’

> “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’

> “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’

> “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’

> “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.” (Matthew 25:31-46 [NIV])

I did not feed this man; I did not feed Christ. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who stepped down from the glory of heaven, lived the perfect life I couldn't live, willingly took my suffering on the cross, died, and rose again to reign forever—to this Jesus, I said "No." My comfort is better, my time is better, my schedule is better. "No, go hungry," I said to my Saviour, Lord, and King.

Go hungry.

How often do we all pass by those in need and not feed the hungry, water the thirsty, welcome the stranger, clothe the naked, visit the sick, nor the prisoner. Shame to us all. Shame on me.

Lest you think this reading just doesn't understand Jesus properly, consider his Sermon on the Mount:

> “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. (Matthew 5:38–42 [NIV])

The very habit which resulted in my goat-like behavior was based in a denial of Jesus' simple teaching: "Give to the one who asks you," "Do not resist an evil person," "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also." My behavior was rooted in an understanding of giving which sought to protect my assets and generosity from those who might abuse them by fueling their own addictions. 

Yet, Jesus says, "Give."

Are we willing to obey our Lord?

Although the Holy Spirit has been convicting me in his own ways, I have been aided in my thinking the past few weeks by sitting under [Ryan Hutchinson](http://about.me/rrhutch)'s teaching at [FBC Durham](http://www.fbcdurham.org/).
