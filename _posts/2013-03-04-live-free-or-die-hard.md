intro: "What is the meaning and significance of Nahum 1?"
---

The Book of Nahum is the recorded prophesy of Nahum regarding God's wrath toward Assyria, specifically the capital of Nineveh, which turned from repentance in the time of Jonah toward wickedly waging war. The whole of the passage is a threat to Nineveh and the enemies of the LORD. The proclamations in <cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1'>Nahum 1</cite> are a detailed expounding both of God's wrath toward his enemies and his protection of his people (cf. Exodus 34:6-7).

<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:2'>Verse 2</cite> reveals repeatedly that the LORD is *jealous and angry* with Nineveh and all his enemies (cf. Exodus 20:5). <cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:3-5'>Verses 3-5</cite> build to describe the awesome power of this angry God. His slowness to anger is a condemnation against Nineveh because they have continued in their wickedness despite his patience (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:3'>v. 3</cite>, cf. Exodus 34:6). The natural disasters of the world are controlled by God: he controls storms, clouds, and dust (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:3'>v. 3</cite>, cf. Exodus 14:21, <cite class='bibleref' title='Psalm 18'>Psalm 18</cite>), he dries the sea and rivers and withers the foliage (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:4'>v. 4</cite>, cf. Psalm 106:9, Isaiah 33:9, 50:2), he creates earthquakes which shake mountains, hills, and all who dwell on earth (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:5'>v. 5</cite>, cf. Jeremiah 4:24, Habakkuk 3:6). Ezekiel 31:3 refers to Assyria as a former cedar in Lebanon.

Now that God's power has been asserted, <cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:6-11'>verses 6-11</cite> proclaim the extent of his executed wrath upon individuals. No one, not even rocks, can endure the fire of his anger and wrath (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:6'>v. 6</cite>, Malachi 3:2, 2 Chronicles 34:21, Psalm 79:6, Ezekiel 38:20). Within this taunt, the prophet extols the goodness of the LORD in that he is a stronghold for those who take refuge in him (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:7'>v. 7</cite>, cf. Psalm 46:1, 100:5, Isaiah 25:4, John 10:14, 1 Corinthians 8:3), which is a reference to Judah taking refuge in God from the Assyrians. In contrast to the LORD's protection of those who come to him, God is able to overwhelm and utterly destroy his enemies (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:8'>v. 8</cite>, Isaiah 8:22, 30:28). In light of this, the prophet explains that it is unthinkable to stand against such a mighty God, because the enemy's schemes stand no chance at overpowering the LORD who can consume his enemies as fire does to dried grass (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:9-11'>vv. 9-11</cite>, Isaiah 10:7, 37:36, Jeremiah 4:27, Micah 7:4, Joel 2:5, 2 Kings 19:22-23).

Previously, the LORD had already protected Jerusalem from the Assyrians by killing 185,000 men overnight (<cite class='bibleref' title='Isaiah 37'>Isaiah 37</cite>). Despite this, the Assyrians still plotted against the LORD. The LORD then proclaims to Judah that the strong Assyrian nation will be cut down utterly and that he will end his affliction of Judah by breaking the bonds of Assyria (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:12-13'>v. 12-13</cite>, cf. Isaiah 10:33-34). Turning back to the Assyrians, the LORD pronounces the imminent destruction of wicked Nineveh and their idol gods (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:14'>v. 14</cite>). Speaking once more to Judah, the prophet commands his people to look to the mountains for the feet of him who brings good news (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:15'>v. 15</cite>), which is a reference to Isaiah 52:7 describing the future salvation of God's people. Paul echoes this sentiment in Romans 10:15, proclaiming that the beautiful feet are of those who preach the Gospel of Christ. The prophet then commands Judah to keep the covenant of the LORD so that the wicked will not hold them in bondage once more (<cite class='bibleref' title='Nahum 1:15'>v. 15</cite>, cf. Exodus 34:11, Numbers 30:2, Joel 3:17).

The significance of this passage of Nahum is its proclamation that all of the enemies of the LORD, both human and spiritual, will eventually perish under his mighty hand, and that Nineveh will soon be utterly destroyed. The LORD commands Judah to keep their covenant while they wait for the Gospel of Salvation, the Gospel of Christ, to be brought down from the mountains.
