*Title*: Build up the Church through Worship  
*Author*: Vernon R. King, III  
*Scripture*: 1 Corinthians 14  
*Tune*: TO GOD BE THE GLORY  
*Composer*: William H. Doane  
*Hymnary*: <http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/UMH/98>  

## Verse 1

Seek gifts of the spirit to benefit all  
In what we are giv'n let's remember our call  
To build up each other with prophetic words  
Not speaking in languages no one has heard  

## Refrain

Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord,  
Let us be as one voice!  
Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord,  
Let Christ's Body rejoice!  
Come worship the Father through Jesus the Son,  
By the pow'r of the Spirit, our God, three-in-one  

## Verse 2

Lifeless instruments can be played in a lurch  
But isn't it better to build up the church?  
Babbling benefits no one under the sun  
Let's excel in building up God's church in love  

### [Refrain]

## Verse 3

Let's be mature thinkers, but infants t'ward sin  
For God uses tongues to judge those against him  
But prophets are used to convict and disclose  
All secrets of heart within God's former foes  

### [Refrain]

## Verse 4

In conduct we must keep our order in mind  
We should always speak only one at a time  
Uplifting the church in love must be our means  
To worship the Godhead who is Trinity  

### [Refrain]
