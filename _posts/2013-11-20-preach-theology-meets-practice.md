*Preach: Theology Meets Practice*. By Mark Dever and Greg Gilbert. Nashville: B&H, 2012, 210 pp., $9.99 Kindle. Reviewed by Vernon R. King, III.

What need is there for another book about preaching? Dever and Gilbert contend a new contribution is necessary because (1) the evangelical church is losing confidence in the preached Word of God, (2) the evangelical church is lacking confidence in biblical exposition, and (3) too many expositional preachers have given a bad name to expository preaching. In response to these three problems, the authors desire to demonstrate "how to expose God's Word to a congregation in a way that's engaging, affecting, and convicting" (p. 6). To the benefit of many evangelical churches, these authors have succeeded in their explicit goal (and more) throughout the work of *Preach: Theology Meets Practice*.

Dever and Gilbert write, "The ability to engage with the preached Word of God is one of the things we as pastors should teach our congregations and should come to expect of them" (p. 46). The authors encourage pastors to teach their congregations to engage with the Word of God by making "the preaching of the Bible the centerpiece of their church's lives" (p. 44). However, aligning engagement with the Word of God and the centrality of preaching in the life of the church seems to be an unnecessary connection. For example, the authors seem to overstate their case, writing, "The sermon is the center of the pastor's responsibility" (p. 48). Despite this quibble, the authors are correct in affirming engagement with the Word of God so that the congregation may learn "to love God more, to love His Son Jesus more, to love one another more in Christ" (p. 48).

Regarding their second goal, the authors write, "When we preach, we preach for change. We preach for effect. In everything, . . . we preach with the goal of spurring believers on in their maturity in Christ and of awakening nonbelievers to their need for the Savior" (p. 52). Throughout the book, Dever and Gilbert return to the necessity of affecting the hearts, souls, and minds of the congregation through effective sermon delivery. With this effect in mind, they encourage much work in both sermon preparation and delivery so that congregation feels the weight of the sermon and is affected for change (p. 124).

Finally, Dever and Gilbert promote expositional preaching as a means for the Holy Spirit to convict the congregants of sin. They write, "Christian preaching seeks change. It cuts against the grain of surrounding culture, it challenges presuppositions, it convicts of sin, and it calls people to put their faith in Jesus Christ" (p. 51). Heralding the good news of Jesus Christ allows the preacher both to "edify believers in Christ" and "call those who do not yet believe to do just that" (p. 57). These two purposes allow the preacher to pray for listeners to hear "something the Holy Spirit would use to convict them of self-dependence and sin" (p. 59). Conviction, repentance, and turning to Christ capture the ideal response to effective expository preaching.

Although *Preach* is not structurally organized around the above goals, the authors accomplish their task throughout the text. Because the three-part structure of the book focuses on theology, practice, and exemplary models, respectively, Dever and Gilbert offer both a unique contribution and a helpful introduction to the field of expository preaching. For preacher and congregant alike, I recommend this book to all seeking an introduction to the theology and practice of expository preaching.
