The end of Christian theology is a life of spiritual formation. God's ultimate work is making a people for himself in the form of himself. We study Scripture so that we may know God. We participate in Christian theology so that we may (1) think rightly about God, (2) speak rightly about God, and (3) live rightly before God. 

We can see this in Colossians 1:9--10, in which Paul prayed for the church,  "asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God" (ESV). As the church grew in the knowledge of God (what we call Christian theology), Paul expected them to walk and bear fruit. Similarly, as we know God more, we become more like him, through the image of his Son, who is the visible image of the invisible God. We, who were made in the image of God, can become like him through knowing him. If we participate in Christian theology but are not spiritually formed into his image, we fail at our task. Understanding godly propositions while neglecting our relationship with God will prove most unfruitful both in this life and the next.

In his letter to the Ephesians, Paul wrote similarly, "we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ . . . you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds" (Eph. 4:15, 17 [ESV]). Unlike the unbelieving Gentiles, our minds must be fruitful so that we may grow up in Christ in every way! If we do not engage our minds with the knowledge of God as revealed in Scripture, we will be far less able to become like Christ because we will know him less. Christ is the visible image of God to us because he has been revealed to us in the Scripture. Outside of Scripture, we have never seen the visible Christ. If we want to become like him, we must see him; to see him, we must turn to the Scripture. Because the task of Christian theology is understanding the story of the Scripture (the gospel of Jesus Christ), the fruit of such theology must be spiritual formation into the likeness of Christ.

> Knowing God involves, first, listening to God’s Word and receiving it as the Holy Spirit interprets it, in application to oneself; second, noting God’s nature and character, as his Word and works reveal it; third, accepting his invitations and doing what he commands; fourth, recognizing and rejoicing in the love that he has shown in thus approaching you and drawing you into this divine fellowship. (J. I. Packer, *Knowing God*, 39)

Knowing God and becoming like him is the necessary fruit of Christian theology. Packer rightly explains this process, for we must first know God's Word, which is inspired by the Holy Spirit, as it is interpreted by the Holy Spirit. This Word both reveals God to us and exposes us before him. As a result, we must apply our lives to the Scripture and change our lives to reflect what we find, especially as it relates to God's nature. While this necessarily includes obeying his commands, knowing God ultimately results in love and appreciation; we have been granted divine fellowship with our creator. 

We begin Christian theology with our faith in the triune God expressed in our Baptism. We source our theology in the inspired, inerrant Scripture so that we may understand the story behind summary message of baptism. We do the work of Christian theology, reading the Scripture, hearing from other saints, so that we may rightly understand the message and Person of Jesus Christ. This person, whom we know, will radically change us. From the seed of faith will blossom a spiritually formed person in the likeness of Christ. The ultimate end of Christian theology is knowing God and being formed in him. Praise be to God that he has chosen to reveal himself to us!
