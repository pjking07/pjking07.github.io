# Opener

As you turn to Psalm 63, contemplate with me the state of David as he pens this psalm. This was likely written during the time of Absalom’s pursuit of his father David. Do you know the story of Absalom? You can read a full account in 2 Samuel 13–17. Absalom resented his father David, conspired against him, and overtook his throne in Jerusalem. As a result, David fled on account of his own life—and then discovered just how deep his son’s conspiracy went. While he was fleeing, David encountered Shimei who cursed David as an enemy of God. Eventually David and the people with him "arrived weary at the Jordan," and refreshed themselves there (2 Sam. 16:14).[^1]

[^1]: Unless otherwise noted, all Scripture references are from the ESV.

David may have written Psalms 61–63 while he sought refreshment at the Jordan. In this collection of psalms, David expresses his longing for the LORD to deliver him. He is emotionally burdened by the conspiracy of his son, he is spiritually burdened by the curses cast upon him, and he is physically burdened by his flight from home.

Beloved, are you also weary and heavy-laden? Have the battles of this world, the flesh, and the devil left you tattered and scared, burdened and faint? Hear then, the hope David has in the LORD his God for deliverance. This same LORD has offered eternal deliverance for you through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus, the Anointed One.

# Text

As you walk away today, I want you to know this: though you may be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus.

Now, let’s read Psalm 63:

> A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
>
> O God, you are my God;  
earnestly I seek you;  
my soul thirsts for you;  
my flesh faints for you,  
as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.  
So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,  
beholding your power and glory.  
Because your steadfast love is better than life,  
my lips will praise you.
>
> So I will bless you as long as I live;  
in your name I will lift up my hands.  
My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food,  
and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips,  
when I remember you upon my bed,  
and meditate on you in the watches of the night;  
for you have been my help,  
and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.  
My soul clings to you;  
your right hand upholds me.
>
> But those who seek to destroy my life  
shall go down into the depths of the earth;  
they shall be given over to the power of the sword;  
they shall be a portion for jackals.  
But the king shall rejoice in God;  
all who swear by him shall exult,  
for the mouths of liars will be stopped.

The Word of the Lord.

## The Gospel

In verse 1, David writes, "O God, you are my God." David declares God’s existence and preeminence, but he also claims a personal connection with God himself. Not only David, but every person in humanity has this capacity for a relationship with God. Today, I want all of us to be able to proclaim along with David, "O God, you are my God."

The only way that any of us can have a personal relationship with God is by receiving the gospel message of Jesus Christ. Because of the sin of the first humans, we were all born separated from God. However, thousands of years ago, God promised that he would bless the earth through a covenant people, Israel, from whom Jesus, the Son of God, was born into the world. Jesus, who was fully God and fully man and a descendent of King David, lived a perfect life, fulfilled the law, and died on a cross as the perfect sacrifice for mankind. By his sacrifice, Jesus satisfied the wrath of God for sinners. Jesus then rose from the dead. He rose from the dead and conquered death, which is the consequence of sin. By trusting in Jesus as Lord over all, sinners everywhere now have the opportunity to repent of their sins before God on high, proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord, and thus be delivered from sin, death, and everlasting torment in the reality of hell.

Knowing God is having a relationship with God the Father through the Lordship of God the Son by the indwelling of God the Holy Spirit. Our text today is a blessing for those who know God, but it serves as a stark warning for those who do not love Jesus as Lord. If you don’t yet know God, then come to know him today.

## I. Earnestly seek God (vv. 1)

Back to verse 1: "O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water."

Do you seek God earnestly as David did? Do you seek him at all? Through the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit, you can seek him in the morning, in your car, at your meals, and at work or school. You can seek him with family, with friends, and even before your enemies. You can seek him in public, at home, and even when you are all alone.

Next, David writes, "My soul thirsts for you." Friends, for what do you allow your soul to thirst? Do you thirst for material things or for the lust of the flesh? Instead, remember what Jesus preached in the Sermon on the Mount, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied" (Matthew 5:6). Be blessed by God and satisfy the thirst of your soul with him.

From verse 1, "My flesh faints for you." David was weary from his flight from his son Absalom. However, each one of us can experience the fainting of the flesh through the spiritual discipline of fasting. By abstaining from physical bread, fasting shows us our need for the bread of life—Christ Jesus and his word. When Jesus himself was fasting in the desert, he rejected the temptation of the devil by quoting Deuteronomy 8:3, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." Consider practicing the spiritual discipline of fasting so that the bread of life may fill you. 

Earnestly seek God. And, always remember, though you may be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus.

## ​II. Earnestly praise God (vv. 2–4)

Despite his terrible circumstances, David writes in verse 2, "So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory." Because David knows God, he also knows where to find him: in the sanctuary, exalted in power and glory. In the same way, we must know God, his character, and his nature. Through the Scripture, we can behold his power and glory, but also his honor, holiness, justice, wrath, long-suffering, his Trinity, unity, eternality, and much more! Praise God by beholding him. Revel in the truth of his nature and character as revealed in Scripture through the Holy Spirit.

In this manner, hear the declaration of the Lord in Exodus 34:6–7:

> "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children’s children, to the third and the fourth generation."

Earnestly praise God by beholding his power and glory.

Returning to our text, David writes in verses 3–4, "Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands." David claims to praise God, bless God, and lift up his hands to God as long as he lives because *God’s steadfast love is better than life*. The love of God is better than life itself! Out of his love, God grants life. Out of his love, God sent his Son. Out of his love, God is merciful to us and has adopted us as his children into his kingdom so that we may live and reign with him as divine royalty in the new heavens and new earth forever.

Earnestly praise God because his love is better than life. To those who are not yet in Christ: give up your lives to God so that you may receive the full measure of God’s love for you.

Always remember, though you may be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus.

## ​III. Earnestly cling to God (vv. 5–8)

Starting in verse 5, David revels in being satisfied in all the works of God and, therefore, clings to the God who upholds him. David writes, "My soul *will be* satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips." David knows that the LORD will satisfy him. Indeed, if you trust in him, the Lord will ultimately deliver you all sin, all wickedness, all strife, and all pain.

David continues, "And my mouth will praise you with joyful lips, when I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night; for you have been my help." David knows what God will do because he knows what God has done! This God who saved Noah from a worldwide flood, who miraculously rescued the Hebrews out of Egypt, who delivered to the Israelites their inheritance in the land of Canaan, who saved Israel and David himself from the giant Goliath—David knows and trusts his God for the future because he knows what God has done in the past. We also can trust God because we know what he has done for us in Christ Jesus. Therefore, meditate on Scripture and remember the good works of the LORD.

Let’s pick back up in the middle of verse 7 leading into 8: "And in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy. My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me." This is a beautiful picture of the relationship we have with God. We cling to God and he holds on to us. In a similar manner, when I walk with my 3 year old down the sidewalk, she places her hand in mine and clings to me. However, it is only by my grip, the loving clasp of a father, that can she be safe from falling. Her own grip is insufficient—without my hand holding hers, she would fall down every time she tripped. She clings with her hand, but she is secured by my hand.

In the same way, *you* must cling to God. You must pursue him. You must love him. You must turn to him. You must use your own effort in your relationship with him. But God is in control. He is the one who upholds you. He gives you life and breath. He empowers you by the Holy Spirit. He saves. He delivers. He keeps his covenant promises. Cling to God for he will hold you.

Cling to God; remember and be satisfied in all his works.

Always remember, though you may be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus.

## ​IV. Earnestly trust God for deliverance (vv. 9–11)

Let’s continue with verses 9–10:

> But those who seek to destroy my life  
shall go down into the depths of the earth;  
they shall be given over to the power of the sword;  
they shall be a portion for jackals.  

Because God appointed David to be King of Israel, all who might seek to destroy David are enemies of God. If we once more consider God’s description of himself in Exodus 34, we know that he is "slow to anger," but "will by no means clear the guilty." Even though he will forgive "iniquity and transgression and sin" he will visit "the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children’s children." How is it that God forgives the iniquity of some, but punishes the iniquity of others? By his mercy, God has provisioned forgiveness for a people he has chosen to trust in his covenant promises as fulfilled in Christ Jesus. Though all of us deserve punishment for our iniquities, Christ’s blood has paid the ransom for sin as realized by all who believe. This saves us from the last days in which, according to 2 Thessalonians 1:7–9, "the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might."

Closing in verse 11, David writes, "But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped." David can pray this imprecatory ending to this psalm because his enemies are God’s enemies. Those who are enemies of God will suffer eternal punishment, but those who swear by God shall rejoice in him. If you do not love God, you are his enemy. Become a friend of God; receive his mercy and forgiveness through Christ Jesus!

God will destroy his enemies and stop the mouths of liars. As Moses wrote after the Shema, "It is the LORD your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear" (Deut. 6:13). Earnestly trust God for deliverance—the same God who will destroy his enemies has made provision for your forgiveness through the sacrifice of his own Son.

Always remember, though you may be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus.

# Conclusion

Know this: You can come and rest at the feet of your deliverer, King Jesus. If you do not have a relationship with him… if you cannot say, "O God, you are my God," then earnestly seek him. As Jesus said in Matthew 7:7–8, "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened." Submit your lives to Jesus Christ, enter through the narrow gate into a life united with God. Seek God and you will find him.
