My Life as a Baptist
====================

I  grew up within the walls of my home church, First Baptist Church of Woodway, a Southern Baptist megachurch near Waco, Texas. My parents were members of this church many years before I was born and remain a part of it today---in fact, my mother has been on staff for the past decade. I professed faith and was baptized there at the age of seven, and participated in all the church's programs throughout my childhood and teen years. Unlike most youth group kids, I was born and bred in a Southern Baptist church and have since remained exclusively Southern Baptist in my church affiliation. In fact, I have regularly attended or joined seven different Southern Baptist churches in as many cities since moving away from my home church. Currently, I am a member at First Baptist Church of Durham, where I am eminently satisfied. I am blessed to co-lead my home fellowship group, as well as teach children's Sunday School alongside my wife.


Why I Am a Baptist Still
========================

Although my parents raised me in a proud Southern Baptist home, I have personally wrestled through the distinctive tenets of the Southern Baptist tradition. Through many years of ongoing study---and a growing love of Baptist ecclesiology---I am increasingly convinced of the ecclesiastical and hermeneutical superiority of my inherited tradition. Below, I will explicate some of the Baptists beliefs that I hold dear.


Word-Driven
-----------

I hesitate to list "Word-driven" as a Baptist distinctive because I do not wish to insult fellow Christians who also take the Bible seriously as the authoritative and inerrant Word of God. However, Baptists only exist because of their perennial desire to be Word-driven, especially in ecclesiology. While the Baptist movement may appear intentionally divisive to outsiders---the first Baptists split from Puritan Separatists, who had split from the Church of England, which had split from the Roman Catholic Church---Baptists exist as a distinct Christian movement because of their right desire to follow the Bible wherever it leads. Without ignoring church history or rejecting historic creeds, Baptists look to the Bible for all matters of faith and practice. Baptists build their churches on the foundation of the Word of God.

Yet, some who claim to be Baptist reject the authority, veracity, and normativity of the Bible. Though those "Baptists" may immerse adults, they do not baptize them into a truly Baptist understanding of God, his revelation, or his gospel. They effectively reject the name that they supposedly hold dear. Just as a Baptist cannot practice paedobaptism, a Baptist cannot hold to a low view of Scripture. To do so would be oxymoronic.


Baptism of Disciples Alone
--------------------------

Baptists are best known for the ecclesial practice for which they are named. Notably, Baptists do not claim to practice the _best_ form of baptism, but the only _true_ form of baptism: the baptism of believers alone. More than any other practice in the church, baptism distinguishes the Baptist church from all other types of Christian churches. One cannot be a Baptist without receiving believer's baptism, or while embracing other forms of so-called baptism.

No substantial historical evidence of paedobaptism exists until Tertullian teaches _against_ the practice in the second century. In addition, the New Testament neither describes nor sanctions the baptism of non-believers such as infants. For example, the Gospel of Matthew closes with Jesus' commissioning his disciples, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you" (Matt. 28:19--20).[^1] In this Great Commission, baptism is for disciples. Jesus told his disciples to go, make disciples, baptize "them," and teach "them." Who are those to be baptized and taught if not the aforementioned disciples? Thus, Jesus instructs his disciples---and all disciples in perpetuity---to baptize only other disciples. The baptism of the Philippian jailer's household also bolsters the argument, though it is a common passage used to argue for paedobaptism (Acts 16:25--34). Although Paul baptizes the jailer and his family, he does so only after speaking the word of the Lord to the jailer "and to all who were in his house" (Acts 16:32). Paul baptizes the family that has heard and presumably responded to the gospel; thus, he baptizes them all as believers.

[^1]: Unless otherwise specified, all Scripture references are from the English Standard Version (ESV).

Furthermore, Baptists have an apostolic precedent for rejecting pseudo-baptisms and requiring converts to submit to biblical baptism. When Paul comes to Ephesus, he finds disciples who have been baptized "into John's baptism" (Acts 19:3). In response, Paul says, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus." Then, Paul baptizes the disciples in the name of Jesus. Although John's baptism serves some purpose during his time, it is not a baptism for those who know Jesus. Following Paul's example, Baptists are justified in demanding believer's baptism for all members, regardless of any pseudo-baptism (particularly, paedobaptism) in their past.


Regenerate Church Membership
----------------------------

Because Baptists baptize believers alone, and baptism is the front door to the church, it naturally follows that Baptists hold to regenerate church membership. That is, every member of a Baptist church is someone whom the church has affirmed as a Christian, though there is naturally a margin for error. If every church were to use correct judgment for every member, Baptist churches would have a wholly Spirit-regenerated membership. In this way, regenerate church membership is an ideal rather than a reality; yet, Baptist churches must continually strive for this ideal.

Of the many analogies the New Testament uses to describe the local church, the Body of Christ perhaps best underscores the need for regenerate church membership. Addressing the local church in Corinth, Paul writes, "Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it" (1 Cor. 12:27). Likewise, he writes to the Ephesian church, "There is one body and one Spirit---just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call---one Lord, one faith, one baptism" (Eph. 4:4--5). Paul tells the Romans, "We, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another" (Rom. 12:5). Thus, Paul makes clear that the local church is the body of Christ, and every regenerate member of the local church is an individual member of that body. Conversely, those who are not members of Christ's body should not be counted as members of Christ's church.


Congregationalism
-----------------

The normative polity of the New Testament is congregational governance (with pastoral leadership) under the headship of Christ. In the oft-debated passage of Matthew 16:13--20, Jesus pronounces that he will build his church upon the rock of Peter and his confession, and subsequently promises to give his apostles the keys of the kingdom of heaven, granting them the authority to bind and loose on earth as it is in heaven. Later, in Matthew 18:15--20, Jesus provides his disciples with a model of church discipline in which he gives the church the authority to bind and loose on behalf of heaven. The congregation of the church is clearly the recipient of this authority because, in  Jesus' model of church discipline, the final step is to "tell [the discipline issue] to the church" (Matt. 18:17).

Furthermore, Jesus reiterates the congregation's receipt of the power of the keys when he says, "Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven." Thus, the binding and loosing authority that Jesus gave to the apostles he also gave to local churches. The congregants of a church have the authority to baptize and identify members (binding) and excommunicate those who no longer provide evidence of the faith (loosing). The New Testament includes other normative examples of the congregation making binding decisions on behalf of the church, including the selection of the seven proto-deacons (Acts 6:3), the commissioning of Barnabas and Saul (Acts 13:2), Paul's exhortation for the Corinthians to excommunicate its immoral member (1 Cor. 5:4--5), and Paul's call to restore a repentant excommunicant (2 Cor. 2:6).

Baptists are especially equipped to operate congregational governance because of their inherited Protestant view of the priesthood of all believers (1 Pet. 2:9), as well as the Baptist distinctive of a regenerate church membership. In fact, congregationalism ought to be closely associated with regenerate church membership because no church of Christ should be subject to the dictates of non-Christians. As believers, these regenerated church members also constitute the priesthood of the church. Though these priest-members have different gifts and offices, the whole priesthood is responsible for the church, under the headship of Christ.


Baptist Now and Forever
=======================

As a committed Southern Baptist, I can foresee myself leaving the convention in very few scenarios. The Southern Baptist Convention requires constant renewal and reform; major examples include the Conservative Resurgence and the Great Commission Resurgence movements of recent history. If, God forbid, the SBC were to stray from the Bible and its Baptist principles without repentance or reform, then the time would come for me (and my church) to associate with other like-minded churches for the advancement of the gospel across the globe.

I can also see myself temporarily leaving the SBC if God calls me to pastor either a church of a different Baptist denomination or a baptistic non-denominational church. I would be sad to leave the SBC and the benefit of its many institutions, especially the seminaries, mission boards, and GuideStone. However, I would also be inclined to lead such a church toward an SBC affiliation, if the opportunity arose.

However, I can never see myself identifying with a non-baptistic church. Even if I move to a place in which no local Baptist church exists, I will simply plant a Baptist church in the area. Actually, my authorization and ability to plant a church wherever I go is one of the many benefits of the Baptist tradition.


Baptists from the Past
======================

The study of Baptist history has grown my love for the Baptist tradition and its ecclesiology. Reading the stories of the men and women who recovered biblical baptism and suffered persecution for their beliefs has strengthened my own convictions regarding the tenets of Baptist belief. Although Baptist history, like all of church history, includes numerous mistakes made by my ecclesiastical forbearers, the lives of Baptist men and women from our past are good models of Christian living and a collective catalyst for Baptist convictions.

I am a better Baptist for knowing the Baptists who came before me. Francis Wayland and Richard Fuller demonstrate how Baptists ought to have civil discourse about areas of disagreement---even areas as significant as chattel slavery---without demonizing or questioning the character of brothers in Christ. P. H. Mell teaches me that a Baptist can serve the church and the world in numerous capacities---some simultaneously---and do it well. Andrew Fuller models how Baptists should engage in polemical arguments against heresies within the church. William Carey and Adoniram Judson each inculcate the Baptist resolve to proclaim the gospel to all the nations, despite suffering and persecution. I hope other Baptists of today will join me in looking to the Baptists of our past so that their example may enable us to better live as Baptists in the future.
