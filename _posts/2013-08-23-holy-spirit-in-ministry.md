The Holy Spirit's presence is requisite for the regenerate church, therefore, he is active in all the ministries of the church. In the ministry of evangelism, the Lord adds to his church through regeneration by the power of the Spirit. Because of the regeneration of believers, the church's evangelistic witness must include the demonstration of a Spirit-transformed life. The church shares the faith and proclaims the Gospel, but only the Spirit converts the unregenerate.

The Holy Spirit empowers the church's ministry of discipleship because it is he who gives the gift of teaching. This gift must be guarded by the Christian through preparation and submission to the empowering Spirit. The church is responsible to teach and train believers, but only the Spirit does the work of sanctification and maturation.

The Spirit empowers the ministry of worship by guiding the church to properly praise and glorify the Triune God. Corporate worship is further empowered by the Spirit's gift of teachers and the right proclamation of the Word. Only by the power of the Spirit can the church effectively exhort one another to grow in holiness and sanctification.

Regarding the ministry of communal fellowship, the Holy Spirit draws together his people under the calling of the Lordship of Jesus Christ. Only he is able to maintain intimate fellowship between believers of diverse backgrounds. The Holy Spirit is the unifying thread in the church and he empowers continuing fellowship despite ourselves.

Through the ministry of mutual service, the Holy Spirit empowers Christians to serve others for their temporal and eternal good. Service ministry is toward both other Christians and non-believers, whose distinct spiritual needs can be met by the Spirit. Without the power of the Holy Spirit, the enteral benefit of mutual service would be lost.

Despite ourselves, the Spirit works in the church today. The church must be dependent upon the Holy Spirit in all that it does. The primary way to experience dependence upon the Holy Spirit is by covering all ministries in prayer. Pursuing genuine prayer prior to and during ministerial action demonstrates, requests, and expects the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Prayer ought to be the first course of action for each of the ministries: evangelism, discipleship, worship, fellowship, and service. Second, it is helpful to communicate the truth of the power of the Spirit. The church must remind itself than any spiritual success is from God, not from human effort. Finally, dependence upon the Spirit can be promoted through the continued teaching of the Trinity. The church must never forget that the Holy Spirit is a person of the Triune God and ought to receive appropriate recognition.
