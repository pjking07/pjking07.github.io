The Holy Spirit is God and brings to completion all of the works of God. As such, the Holy Spirit is integral to our own conversion. Indeed, without the Holy Spirit, there would be no conversions, because the work of salvation and conversion would not be completed.

In his letter to the Ephesians, Paul teaches that the Holy Spirit is received upon conversion as a seal and guarantee of our eternal inheritance (Eph. 1:13--14). In the same moment someone believes the gospel of Christ Jesus, he is filled with the presence of the indwelling Holy Spirit. The presence of the indwelling Holy Spirit identifies a Christian, guarantees the heavenly reward for the saint, and effects good works that are evidence of conversion.

Christians are "created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand" (Eph. 2:10 [ESV]). Some of these good works are known as the fruit of the Spirit: "love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control" (Gal. 5:22--23 [ESV]). Godly works and the fruit of the Spirit are evidence of the presence of the Spirit. Jesus said, "Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing" (John 15:5 [ESV]). This fruit is the fruit of the Spirit, who is the Spirit of Christ. Indeed, through the Spirit, Christ dwells in our hearts through faith (Eph. 3:16--17). Therefore, the Spirit denotes our conversion and is the power of God living within us.

Jesus Christ himself offered his blood as a sacrifice through the eternal Spirit of God in order to "purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God" (Heb. 9:14). Indeed, prior to having the Spirit, we had the works of the flesh: "sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies" (Gal. 5:19--21 [ESV]). Through the Spirit, we have been cleansed from these dead works and have been given the fruit of the Spirit so that we may serve the living God.

God promised Ezekiel, "And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh" (Ezek. 36:26 [ESV]). Along with new hearts, God gives Christians a new spirit, the Holy Spirit to dwell within us. Without the power of God dwelling within us, we cannot participate in Christ's life of obedience, as we must. Indeed, we would still be separated from God today, despite the perfect sacrifice of the God-man. Only by having the Spirit within us can we Christians participate in the blessings of God in our earthly lives. 

Furthermore, God's work of salvation cannot be completed without God's presence within us through the Spirit. Without the working of the Spirit in our mind, will, and heart, we would not be able to receive the gift of faith, for it is only by our own transformation that we may believe and be united with Christ by the Spirit. This very transformation is the work of the Spirit. By the will of the Father and the sacrifice of Christ, the Spirit effectively completes our justification by the transformative gift of faith. 

The Holy Spirit is at work through every stage of our salvation: justification, glorification, and sanctification. The same Spirit who effects the gift of faith in our hearts also guides us along the path of sanctification (1 Pet. 1:2). Surely, then, he will also bring to completion our very resurrection so that we may obtain our glorious inheritance for which we are sealed by the Spirit.
