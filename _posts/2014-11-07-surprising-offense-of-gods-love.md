The local church publicly exercises godly love through the institutions of membership and discipline. This is the thrust of Jonathan Leeman's inaugural book, a comprehensive treatise detailing the nature of God's love and its direct impact on the life and polity of the church. After the author deconstructs the contemporary, Western understanding of love—which he sees as rooted in individualism, consumerism, skepticism, and more—he defends his thesis by reconstructing the biblical definition of godly love and expounding upon love's implications for the church in the form of meaningful membership and effective discipline. Leeman's argument is captured in his statement that true love is "the lover's affirmation of and affection for the beloved and the beloved's good in the Holy" (108).

Leeman argues that this holiness-seeking love is demonstrated through the loving authority of the church---bestowed by Jesus as an ambassadorial expression of God's own authority---and the submission of Christians to God and to one another. The church, as Christ's proxy, has the authority and responsibility to identify those who do and do not belong to Christ through the constructs of membership and discipline. In his final chapters, Leeman provides practical application for churches that desire to define God's love for the world through local church membership and discipline.

As the title suggests, the structure and content of this book is primarily concerned with God's love; each section and chapter orients the reader with an aspect of love. The author rightly identifies the contemporary aversion to church membership and (especially) discipline as being rooted in an ungodly understanding of love, and responds with an excellent framework for godly love. Therefore, many congregants would benefit from Leeman's analysis, deconstruction, and reconstruction of true love.

Regrettably, Leeman's work suffers from sermonic repetition and a too-casual tone, an overabundance of illustrations, and prose-like verbosity. As a result, this book is much longer than necessary. Indeed, with intense editing, a significant percentage of the text could be removed without reducing the quality of the core material. This book's unnecessary length may deter many who might otherwise have benefited from the author's work.

In addition, as Leeman's argument progresses, the focus of his content shifts from the nature of love to its expression, namely, church membership and discipline. As a result, since love and polity are tightly coupled throughout the book, Leeman has relatively little left to say in the way of application. Perhaps the book would have flow better if the author had focused exclusively on the nature of love in part one before articulating its expression and application in the church in part two.

On the other hand, Leeman's book is eminently navigable. Although the length of the book (and the depth of its sub-points) might suggest a reader could get lost in its contents, the book's clearly articulated outline provides a helpful and reliable guide. The first appendix recapitulates the outline of the book, in which each chapter asks a "main question" and provides a "main answer" with multi-step argumentation. This organization makes it suitable for use as a pseudo-reference work.

In any case, Leeman's systematic analysis of God's love and its expression through church membership and discipline is unassailably logical and biblical. Jonathan Leeman serves the church well by identifying the modern misconceptions of love and providing a righteous redefinition that Christ's church ought to reflect. This love is godly and holy, steeped in biblical authority and submission. If churches today lived by the love of God demonstrated in church membership and discipline that Leeman describes, there would be revitalization throughout the globe.
