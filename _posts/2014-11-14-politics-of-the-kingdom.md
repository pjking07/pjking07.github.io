In his forthcoming book, _A Political Assembly_, Jonathan Leeman explicates the analogy for the church he has been developing for the last few years: the local church as a heavenly embassy. While the author has introduced this embassorial analogy in other works, this book is his first monograph dedicated to the subject. According to Leeman, the majority of the book prepares the reader for his "actual argument", contained in the final chapter, "The Politics of the Kingdom." Leeman writes to convince his readers that "the local church and its members constitute a political community" whose purpose "is to publicly represent King Jesus, display the justice and righteousness of the Triune God, and pronounce that all the world belongs to this king." Leeman progresses his argument by describing the eschatological assembly (universal church) as a political assembly, and by "demonstrating that this political assembly is manifested . . . through the exercise of the keys of the kingdom."

If the previous chapters prepare the reader for the final chapter, then that final chapter prepares the reader for the final section, "Matthew (Part 2): Keys of the Kingdom." Here, Leeman explains his view of the local church and its relationship to the keys of the kingdom: the congregation holds the keys and exercises them through the inclusion and exclusion of members within the church. However, Leeman has already described his views regarding the keys of the kingdom in previous works.[^B3-1] Therefore, for those who have read Leeman's prior publications, the culmination of this book may seem anticlimactic.

Furthermore, Leeman both argues for and defends his ultimate conclusion before fully explaining that conclusion. The reader can lose sight of the forest for the trees as the author defends his incomplete argument against seemingly peripheral opponents. For example, Leeman spends many pages interacting with N. T. Wright's "New Perspective on Paul" as well as Paul's doctrine of justification, at the end of which the author asks, "Why is all this significant for our political enquiries?" By posing this question, Leeman rightly acknowledges that the point of his tangent may be lost on his readers. Perhaps Leeman should have explained his conclusion first, then thoroughly defended it against alternative views, rather than writing a thorough argument toward an unrevealed conclusion. That way, the reader would be better equipped to follow Leeman as he delves into the crevices of his argumentation and defense.

At the end of his final chapter, Leeman identifies one consequence of comparing the local church to an embassy; namely, religious tolerance. In this section, the author returns to a thread from previous chapters arguing for the necessity of religious liberty within the state. While religious tolerance is a necessary consequence of Leeman's argument, it is an ill-fitting topic for the book's dénouement. Rather than discuss the implications of religious tolerance in multiple, scattered sections, Leeman could better address the theme within its own chapter or appendix.

The final chapter simply attempts too much. Leeman could have easily split the material into three separate chapters. Unfortunately, the thoroughness of each argument is lost in the multiplicity of arguments given. However, particularly if it is reorganized, Leeman's contribution will greatly enhance the Baptist understanding of the nature of the local church. I look forward to reading the entirety of this work once IVP Academic publishes it.
