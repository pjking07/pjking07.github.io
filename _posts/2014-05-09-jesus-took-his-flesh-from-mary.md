The Son has eternally existed as the Son, being both God and with God. This Son incarnated, taking on human flesh, in order to save humanity from its sins and unite men with God. The Son incarnated as Jesus through a miraculous, virginal conception within Mary. This conception takes place not only within Mary but with Mary. Mary and her flesh conceive, by the Spirit, the God-man Jesus. Because the Spirit conceived a child within Mary, Jesus took his own flesh from Mary. Jesus' humanity is rooted in and inherited from the humanity of his mother Mary. Contra the Hoffmanite heresy, Jesus did not merely occupy Mary's womb, as one separated from her flesh, and emerge from her body as water through a pipe. No, the Holy Spirit conceived within Mary her own son, the God-man Jesus. 

Jesus is fully human and the same kind of human as Mary. This is significant for many reasons. First, the prophesied Son of Abraham and David must be a human descendent of Abraham and David. The prophesied son cannot be a presumed or apparent son, but must be a legitimate son. Additionally, in order to save people from their sin, Jesus must be a son of Adam, of whom all are descended, for our curse is rooted in our *adamic* lineage. 

Jesus came to save humanity, not just a part of humanity. In order to redeem a human person, Jesus had to become a full human person; if we say that Jesus was not human or lacked certain attributes of humanity, then we humans have no hope of being fully saved. We must celebrate Jesus' genuine humanity; he must be fully the Son of Adam, Abraham, David, and God in order to fulfill and accomplish all of the work set before him.  Because Jesus was conceived as a son of Mary (and descended from Adam), he is *homoousia* with us. Jesus' genealogy shows that he is the same kind of being as we are. 

Because we are descended from Adam, we are separated form God and have the curse of spiritual and physical death. Jesus came into the world to save such people. In order to take care of both of these problems, Jesus must be fully man and fully God. He needs both natures in order to conquer sin and death and unite us with God. The human nature of Jesus is identical to our own human nature; Jesus was fallen in Adam in exactly the same was we are fallen in Adam. However, despite his fallen nature, Jesus lived the perfect human life, battling and overcoming sin at every temptation.

Jesus was fully God and fully man. He did not merely appear to be a man, he was not partly a man, and he was not only a man. Jesus was the perfect, true, and universal human. Jesus had a human body and a human soul. Jesus lived as a fallen human in a fallen world; he faced temptation, yet did not sin. Jesus is a human person and shares all the characteristics of humanity. Jesus was not protected from our infirmities, but was touched by them so that he could heal them. By his own humiliation, Jesus saves us.

Furthermore, the Incarnation was not a transformation, in which Jesus took off the robe of divinity and put on the robe of humanity. Nor did Jesus become a third thing, a *tertium quid*, by combining divinity and humanity. Rather, the Son of God became a human, living both a human life along and a divine life. God became man, having neither diminished his humanity nor his divinity. 

Jesus' humanity is no different than our humanity (contra Docetism). Jesus incarnated with a human mind, soul, and body (contra Apollinarianism). Jesus is not a human being who was adopted as the Son of God (contra adoptionism). Jesus is the Son of God become man. Everything Jesus experienced, the Son experienced (contra Nestorianism). All that Jesus endured, the Son of God endured.

The Son became man so that he could save mankind. If Jesus were not both fully God and fully man, he would be incapable of fully saving men. Praise God that the Son entered the world, took his flesh from Mary, and reunited humanity with divinity so that the world might be saved.
