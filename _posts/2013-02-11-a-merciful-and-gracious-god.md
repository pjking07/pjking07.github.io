<cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 24:12-31:18">Exodus 24:12-31:18</cite> describe the writing of the first Ten Commandments. However, Israel quickly turned from the LORD in <cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 32">Exodus 32</cite>, and Moses responded by breaking the first tablets in anger. By the end of <cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 33">Exodus 33</cite>, Moses is interceding for Israel, that the LORD might maintain his covenant with them. It is within this context that the LORD is calling Moses up Mount Sinai to receive the tablets again (<cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 34:1">v. 1</cite>).
In <cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 34:11-27">vv. 11-27</cite>, the LORD repeats commandments for Israel regarding their renewed covenant. The commandments are many, and revisit those established in Exodus chapters <cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 12">12</cite>, <cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 13">13</cite>, <cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 20">20</cite>, and <cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 23">23</cite>. Significantly, the LORD is not adding any laws during this covenant renewal.

The LORD proclaims great truths about himself in <cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 34:6-7">vv. 6-7</cite>, truths which are repeated throughout Scripture. <cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 34:6">Verse 6</cite> proclaims his mercy, slowness to anger, and steadfast love, which are all clearly repeated in Numbers 14:18, 2 Chronicles 20:9, Nehemiah 9:17, Psalm 86:15, Psalm 103:8, Psalm 145:8, and Joel 2:13. His forgiveness toward the repentant is contrasted with his just treatment of the unrepentant in <cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 34:7">v. 7</cite> which is echoed in Exodus 23:21, Deuteronomy 5:9-10, Jeremiah 32:18, Job 10:14, Nahum 1:3, and 1 John 1:9.

Moses was fasting on Mount Sinai in the presence of the LORD for forty days and forty nights (<cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 34:28">v. 28</cite>). A duration of forty (days or years) typically denotes a significant event in redemptive history. For forty years Israel wandered in the desert (Numbers 14:33), King David ruled over Israel (1 Kings 2:11), and King Solomon reigned in Jerusalem (1 Kings 11:42). For forty days rain fell on the earth (Genesis 7:4, 8:6), spies observed Canaan (Numbers 13:25), Goliath humiliated Israel (1 Samuel 17: 16), Elijah hid on Mount Horeb (1 Kings 19:1), Jonah warned Nineveh (Jonah 3:4), Jesus fasted in the wilderness (Matthew 4:2), and our resurrected Christ taught on earth (Acts 1:3).
When Moses descended Mount Sinai, his face shone with the glory of God (<cite class="bibleref" title="Exodus 34:29">v. 29</cite>). In 2 Corinthians 3:7-11, Paul uses Moses’ fading reflection (representing God’s glory in the law) as a contrast to the greater, permanent glory shone through the ministry of the Spirit. In 2 Corinthians 3:12-18, Paul goes on to compare the veil of Moses to a metaphorical veil over the hearts of those now reading the old covenant without Christ. Only the LORD can remove that veil, and therefore offer the freedom to behold the glory of the Lord and while being transformed into the image of Christ.

# Significance of the Text

The majority of this text focuses on the repeated commands for Israel in their renewed covenant with the LORD. More significantly, the LORD uses this renewed covenant with fallen Israel as another example that he is merciful, loving, forgiving, and just. Paul’s interpretation establishes that the glory of God in the law revealed on Mount Sinai is not as great as the glory he revealed later through the Spirit. Paul’s insight into the metaphor of the veil shows that there was one man who was greater than Moses: Jesus, the Son of the Living God.
