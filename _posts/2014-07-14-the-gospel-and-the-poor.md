Keller's work on the gospel and the poor offers a thorough biblical overview of ministry to the poor followed by points of application for Christians and local churches. Notably, Keller makes a proper distinction between justice and mercy. Extending mercy is acting out of compassion for those in need; doing justice addresses issues behind social inequality. Keller argues that the church must serve the poor in both mercy and justice.

Offering a one-time handout is a relatively simple and inexpensive process. Even offering repeated handouts (while obviously more expensive) does not require much strategy or planning. However, addressing issues of injustice, particularly systemic injustice, requires far more energy and coordination. While a church may be able to figure out how to advocate for the injustice of one family, how should the church advocate for an entire community? Such a task becomes even more daunting on a city, state, national, and even global scale---nay, overwhelming.

Rather than becoming overwhelmed with systemic injustice on too large a scale, Christians and churches would do well to be merciful and do justice in sustainable (sacrificial) ways. Though not limited to the immediate community, a church should start where immediate opportunities already exist for extending mercy and doing justice. In as much as a church has success in those endeavors, perhaps it could then expand its horizons into other communities. 

The church must return to being known as a people promoting mercy and justice in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The mercy ministries of the early church were an effective apologetic for the surrounding communities. For example, when plagues hit the Empire, Christians remained to care for the ill, even sacrificing their own lives. How can the modern church regain the names of mercy and justice, making much of God by sacrificially loving others? Though the answers are varied, asking the question is the right place to start.
