# Introduction

There is a growing movement today in which local churches are actively engaging and reaching their cities. Many of the exemplified churches in this movement are young, multi-campus mega-churches.[^I-1a] The reach, resources, and influence of these churches is unparalleled for smaller, established congregations. Unfortunately, this leaves a void of examples for a typical local church trying to reach its community. Models are lacking even more for a congregation which itself needs revitalizing; for it is one task to plant a church hoping to reach the city, but it is quite another to re-orient an existing church in order to emphasize reaching out to the hurt and lost. In light of this absence, this paper will present a long-term revitalization model beginning with a local church and ending with the city. What follows is a broad overview of a three-part, parallel approach to bring about citywide revival by revitalizing the local church so that it can join together with sister churches in order to reach the city with the gospel.

# Prerequisites

Before considering any practical steps toward revitalization, one must acknowledge important prerequisites for such a task. Prayer is essential to the Christian life and is especially significant for anyone wanting to see God move in a church or city. Attempting revitalization without continual prayer is arrogant and sure to fail. Any leader or laity hoping to see a movement of God must pray to the one God who made all and sustains all. Even the task of revitalization may draw one away from prayer and toward a self-reliant attitude; this must be resisted because prayer is of utmost importance to any revitalization effort.[^P-1a] 

[^P-1a]: Mike Dodson, "Comeback Churches" (class lecture, SEND North America Conference, Dallas, July 29, 2013).

After prayer, "revitalization is a leadership issue."[^P-2a] Revitalization requires pastors and congregants to step up, catch God's vision, and lead the church through the difficult process of rediscovering its purpose and mission. Following God's own guidance, any change in the church begins with leaders.[^P-2b] Indeed, strategic and intentional leadership is a foundational factor to revitalized growth.[^P-2c]

Finally, revival requires a growing love for God and his Word. All authority is in God himself and he is supreme, but he has chosen to reveal himself through Scripture; one must believe his Word in order to know him. Any church which refuses to define God by his own revelation is not a Christian church. Therefore, prayerful leaders must teach and model the whole counsel of Scripture to those they hope to revive and revitalize. 

# Revitalize the Local Church

Citywide revival requires a healthy local church. The process outlined below will begin by revitalizing a struggling local church. Even healthy churches need to be constantly monitoring themselves, growing ever more in knowing, living, and teaching the gospel of Christ. Every church will find itself somewhere on the continuum of revitalization in which gospel revival leads to church reform and reproduction.

## Revive

A dead church cannot be revitalized until it first has been revived with the gospel. Many in struggling congregations are lost and must be found by Christ. Even those who are active in the church building can be fooled "into thinking that simply being busy in church work automatically brings a fruitful and a faithful life. But this is not so."[^R-R-1a] Thankfully, God is "rich in mercy" and so loves his church that "even when we were dead in our trespasses, [he] made us alive together with Christ" (Ephesians 2:4--5).[^R-R-1b]  God will save his church, but his gospel message must be taught, lived, and modeled by leaders in order to affect change in those who are still dead in their trespasses.

[^R-R-1b]: Unless otherwise noted, all Scripture references are from the ESV.

Before a church can focus on the lost outside of the building, it must reach and transform those already inside. This can be a slow and tedious time of teaching during which those who thought they were Christians must relearn the Christian message so that they can assess themselves appropriately in light of the gospel. This will also be a time in which believers will be reminded of the gospel and the life change it demands.

## Reform

While teaching and modeling the good news of Christ is an ongoing task, there will come a time when the regenerating church is ready for reform. Reforming a local church involves removing unhealthy structures, polity, activities, and programs and replacing them with those that are biblically sound. One can assume that any attempt to reform a church too early, especially prior to its own revival, will fail because people would still be holding to institutionalism and tradition over the God of the gospel.[^R-Ref-1a] 

Reform in a traditional Southern Baptist church may require changes in many aspects of church life. Briefly noted, these reforms may include (1) returning to meaningful membership and church discipline, (2) eliminating certain programs, (3) moving toward a multiple-pastor/elder leadership model, (4) restructuring the diaconate to emphasize servant ministry, (5) unifying corporate worship,[^R-Ref-1b] and (6) frequently observing the Lord's Supper. A regenerate congregation that cherishes the revealed Word of God can patiently learn to reform any aspect of the church as biblical teaching demands. Teaching must precede change, often to the point that the church begins to demand the change which is being taught.

Kenny Lamb, "Renewing Worship" (guest lecture, Ministry of Worship class, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, July 26, 2013).

## Reproduce

All aspects of Christianity ought to multiply: disciples, ministry, leaders, groups, and churches.[^R-Rep-1a] A church which believes the gospel, loves God, and is properly structured needs to prioritize reproduction through outreach and discipleship, leadership training, church planting, and revitalizing other churches. Every Christian should be multiplying his faith by reaching out to the lost around him. The Christian should not be sheltered from those who do not know God. Rather, the Christian ought to stand out in the world around him, offering something better than what the world has. Following, every believer ought to participate in discipleship, both as a learner and a teacher. Furthermore, discipleship should not be treated merely as the transmission of information, but as an intimate modeling of the Christian life in the home, workplace, marketplace, and church.[^R-Rep-1b] Through discipleship and leadership opportunities, leaders ought to be raised up and trained to be ministers of the gospel. The church needs biblically qualified leaders who have been trained by example and are ready to lead in the same manner.[^R-Rep-1c] Through leadership development, new churches ought to be started and dying churches revitalized. Churches cannot multiply without trained leaders ready to go out, reach an area with the gospel, and strengthen the Church of God.

The ultimate goal of church revitalization is growing and multiplying worshipers of the Almighty God. Increasing the number of ambassadors for Christ is more important than any one church's growth. Expanding the reach of the gospel through church planting and revitalization is more effective than attempting to do everything through one church. Revitalization leads to reproduction because churches are not building their own kingdoms, but are working alongside God to build up his future kingdom.

# Join Together with Sister Churches

A local church that desires citywide revival must work in tandem with like-minded churches. An autonomous local church, such as one in the Southern Baptist tradition, may identify such sister churches however it chooses. However, properly joining together for citywide revival will require assessing, strengthening, and associating with churches for the sake of the gospel in the city.

## Assess

An autonomous church should not associate with other churches without assessment. Obviously, associating with a church that does not believe the gospel will hurt, not help, the cause of Christ in the city. More hands do not necessarily lead to better work. Rather, if one church desires to partner with another local church, the one should assess the other in order to understand its fitness for reviving the city with the gospel of Christ. 

Doctrine ought to be of primary importance in choosing partners in ministry.[^J-A-1a] As a helpful measure, Christian doctrine is often systematized into three tiers of importance.[^J-A-1b] (1) Essential doctrines are those which are orthodox and requisite for the Christian faith, e.g., the bodily death and resurrection of Jesus. (2) Secondary doctrines are open to interpretation within Christian orthodoxy, yet are important enough to Christian life and practice that churches may choose to peacefully separate on their account, e.g., polity and baptism. (3) Tertiary doctrines are those that should not create a barrier to Christian fellowship, e.g., eschatological nuances and preferred Bible translations. Doctrinal assessment will enable one church to decide how to partner with other local churches, as will be discussed below.

[^J-A-1a]: Josh Ellis, "Repaving the Road: Mapping the Future of Southern Baptist Associations" (breakout session, SEND North America Conference, Dallas, July 30, 2013).

[^J-A-1b]: Bruce Ashford, "Nine Pointers on being a Student at a Great Commission Seminary" (lecture, Chapel, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, March 5, 2013). 

A doctrinally like-minded church should also be assessed for distinctives and distinguishing factors, e.g., prioritized doctrines, polity, worship style, ministry, location, racial mix, socio-economic condition, generational integration, and size. Knowing these distinctives enables informed decisions regarding partnership, cost-sharing ability, expertise, and areas of focus. However, one must keep in mind that the ultimate goal of assessing another church is the promotion of the gospel, not bringing condemnation. Ideally, an assessment will lead a church into either assistance or association.

## Assist

Through the assessment process, one should expect to find other local churches that need to be revitalized. If these churches can see their own need for strengthening, then one church has a great opportunity to assist another in revitalization. For the one church, this would be part of the reproduction phase of revitalization; for the other, this may be the beginning. Strengthening other churches requires time, resources, leadership, and possibly the transferal of members. However, it is worth the cost because a stronger sister church glorifies God and will be a helpful partner in future ministry. Again, one must not build up a personal kingdom, but must focus on God's kingdom. 

Unfortunately, many churches that require revitalization will not acknowledge their own need. In these cases, one must continue in prayer that God would move hearts and raise up leaders to bring about a renewed focus on the gospel. One cannot force revitalization upon another church, but must be eager to help when the opportunity arises. 

## Associate

Associating with other local churches promotes unity across the city and leads to the advancement of the gospel, for "the assignment is bigger than what any one church can do by itself."[^J-Assoc-1a] Regarding doctrine, churches should associate somewhere in the secondary tier, as described above. Sister churches are not expected to be identical to one's local church, but must be like-minded enough to enjoy fellowship and receive whole-hearted recommendations. However, a church ought to consider engaging in different types of partnerships with churches along the theological spectrum. One question to ask when considering whether to partner for a given ministry would be, "Will this ministry draw people into a local church?" Perhaps a church could partner more narrowly in ministries which bring people into churches, e.g., outreach and church planting, but partner more broadly in ministries which are less likely to draw someone to a given church, e.g., disaster relief and adoption assistance.

[^J-Assoc-1a]: Jack Graham, "Multiplying Leaders" (opening general session, SEND North America Conference, July 29, 2013).

In Southern Baptist life, partnering with other churches will often take the form of a local association. Although many associations require reform, locally clustered associations are sure to grow in the near future, especially outside of major metropolitan areas. The current trend is for national networks and conventions, e.g. the North American Mission Board, to focus on cities, especially those outside the "Bible Belt." While this strategy is commendable for reaching new areas, it largely ignores the American south. No outside entity is going to come and reach the areas where Southern Baptist churches already exist *en masse*.  Therefore, it is up to the local churches to geographically cluster and associate in order to strengthen existing churches, plant new ones, and reach the city together with the gospel.

# Reach the City with the Gospel

Strengthened, gospel-focused local churches must actively reach their city with the gospel, for Jesus said, "You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth" (Acts 1:8). Properly applying Jesus' command, the local church ought to be a witness to its city, region, and the remote parts of the world. While there often is an appropriate focus on international missions, many congregations ignore their own cities and instead isolate themselves within the walls of the church building for their own comfort and to their own detriment. However, Jesus called the local church to be a witness in its city. Therefore, an essential component to local church revitalization and citywide revival is to return the church's witness to the city, outside the walls of the church building. The comfortable church will need to learn to sacrifice itself in order to serve others and share the gospel with the city.

## Sacrifice

The church must remember that Christ Jesus, the Son of God, suffered as a sacrifice for sins. He humbled himself, refused to avail himself of the rights and comforts of his deity, and gave up his whole self on account of the lost. How can Christ's church respond to his gift and model without also subjecting itself to sacrificial living? For, "The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs---heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him" (Romans 8:16--17).

The congregants of a comfortable church must be trained to live sacrificially, giving all of themselves to the commission which God has placed on their lives. Consider Paul's teaching regarding his own suffering:

> Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions. Of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ. For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within me. (Colossians 1:24--29)

## Serve

Lives of service should flow out of sacrificial living. Sacrificing oneself through schedules, finances, and sense of comfort enables one to serve others. "For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another" (Galatians 5:13). Indeed, "As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace" (1 Peter 4:10). Christians who are not sacrificially serving others should be concerned, for "faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead" (James 2:17). 

Scripture teaches the Christian both to serve the needs of his brothers and sisters in Christ[^R-Serve-2a] and to serve the disenfranchised he comes upon.[^R-Serve-2b] Such service will often meet a physical need, but one must never ignore the spiritual need. Service toward others must be gospel-focused, for it is only by sharing Christ that one can truly serve another.

[^R-Serve-2a]: E.g., James 2:14--17; 1 John 3:17--18; Matthew 25:40.

[^R-Serve-2b]: E.g., James 1:27; Matthew 5:42.

## Share

Providing someone with water without telling him about the living water fails to proclaim the gospel of Christ, who said, "Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again" (John 4:13--14). One serves for temporal good, but one shares Christ for eternal good. In the same way that "faith apart from works is useless" (James 2:20), works without faith are dead (Hebrews 9:14).  A Christian cannot claim to serve someone by leaving him as one who cannot please God; holistic service requires telling him of the faith that does please God (Romans 8:8, Hebrews 11:6).

Furthermore, many who need to hear the gospel of Christ may have no particular need of physical service. Those who have food, water, clothing, and money can still be lost in their sins and need to hear the message of the cross of Christ. Because of this lack of physical need, "only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 19:23). Yet, Christians are called to "proclaim the gospel to the whole creation" (Mark 16:15), even to those who require no service. Therefore, service must not be viewed as an end, but as a means to proclaiming the Word of Christ to a lost and dying generation. As Paul writes, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, 'The righteous shall live by faith'" (Romans 1:16--17).

# Conclusion

Though it may take decades, citywide revival is possible if local churches work together to grow in health, serve the area, and reach the city with the gospel. Upheld by prayer, leadership, and a love for God and his Word, a local church must strengthen and revitalize itself with the gospel of Christ, assist other churches in doing the same, and reach the city with the gospel by meeting its physical and spiritual needs. May all Christians awaken to the great need around them, open the doors of their churches, and step outside in order to draw the city into Christ.

> You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. (Matthew 5:14--16)
