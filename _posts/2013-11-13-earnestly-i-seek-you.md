# Opener

As you turn to Psalm 63, contemplate with me the state of David as he pens this psalm. This was likely written during the time of Absalomâ€™s pursuit of his father David. Do you know the story of Absalom? You can read a full account in 2 Samuel 13--17. Out of vengeance and hatred, Absalom murdered his brother Amnon and therefore fled. After three years, Absalom returned to his father David and was permitted to live in his house. However, David refused to see his murderous son, until two years later when he relented. Wickedly, Absalom resented his father David and conspired against him and overtook the throne in Jerusalem. As a result, David fled in order to keep his own life. While fleeing, he discovered just how deep his son's conspiracy went. 

While he was fleeing, David encountered Shimei who cursed David as a worthless man, claiming, "The LORD has avenged on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See your evil is on you, for you are a man of blood" (2 Sam. 16:7--8). When his men requested to kill Shimei for his cursing, David responded, "Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Leave him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to. It may be that the LORD will look on the wrong done to me, and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing today" (2 Sam. 16:11--12). Following this, David the king and the people with him "arrived weary at the Jordan. And there he refreshed himself" (2 Sam. 16:14).[^1]

[^1]: Unless otherwise noted, all Scripture references are from the ESV Bible.

It was here that David may have written Psalms 61--63, in each of which David expresses his longing for the LORD to deliver him. He is physically burdened by his flight from home. He is emotionally burdened by the conspiracy of his son. He is spiritually burdened by the curses cast upon him. Beloved, are you weary and heavy laden? Have the battles of this world, your flesh, or the devil left you tattered and scarred, burdened and faint? Hear then the hope David has in the LORD his God for deliverance. This same LORD has offered eternal deliverance for you through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus, the Anointed One.

# Text

If you come away with only one thought from this sermon, I want you to know this: "Though you may be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus." As we will see in the text, Psalm 63 provides a model for you to (1) earnestly seek God, (2) earnestly praise God, (3) earnestly cling to God, and (4) earnestly trust God for deliverance.

Let's read Psalm 63:

> A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

> O God, you are my God;  
earnestly I seek you;  
my soul thirsts for you;  
my flesh faints for you,  
as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.  
So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,  
beholding your power and glory.  
Because your steadfast love is better than life,  
my lips will praise you.  

> So I will bless you as long as I live;  
in your name I will lift up my hands.  
My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food,  
and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips,  
when I remember you upon my bed,  
and meditate on you in the watches of the night;  
for you have been my help,  
and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.  
My soul clings to you;  
your right hand upholds me.  

> But those who seek to destroy my life  
shall go down into the depths of the earth;  
they shall be given over to the power of the sword;  
they shall be a portion for jackals.  
But the king shall rejoice in God;  
all who swear by him shall exult,  
for the mouths of liars will be stopped.  

## I. Earnestly seek God (vv. 1--2)

Out of the gate, David has already declared wonderful truths. "O God, you are my God." David declares that the one true God, the God of the universe is not only the King eternal, but he claims a personal relationship with this God. Friend, can you claim the same relationship for yourself? Do you intimately know the God who made you? If you do not, I want you to consider through this sermon and text the great gospel of Jesus. God made his creation in perfection, but our first parents, Adam and Eve, were successfully tempted by Satan, the devil, and deliberately chose to sin against this great God, thereby bringing sin into the world and its consequences, death and separation from God. First, God covenanted with a people, Israel, in order to bless the earth. Furthermore, God gave his law so that his holiness and righteousness might be understood by all. Ultimately, this law demonstrated to mankind that no man could be good enough to satisfy God's holiness, for God demanded perfection. As Paul wrote in Romans 3:19--20:

> Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.

Eventually, God chose King David, a man after God's own heart, to rule over Israel. Out of David's genealogical lineage, Jesus, the Son of God, was born into the world. Jesus, the God-man, lived a perfect life, fulfilled the law, fulfilled every type and prophecy of the Old Testament, and died on the cross as a perfect sacrifice for mankind. By his sacrifice, Jesus satisfied the wrath of God for sinners. Jesus then rose from the dead. Yes, you are hearing this right---he rose from the dead and therein conquered the consequence of sin, namely, death. By trusting in Jesus as LORD over all, following his commands, loving God and loving others, sinners everywhere have the opportunity to turn from their sins, confessing them, and repenting before God on high, and thus be delivered from sin, death, and hell. This is what we mean by knowing God: maintaining a relationship with God through the Lordship of his Son and the indwelling of his Holy Spirit. Do you know God in this way? Are you able to proclaim, "O God, you are my God," as David did? If not, dear friend, come to know this God. Our text today is a blessing for those who know God, but, as we will see in verses 9--11, it does not bode well for those who do not follow Jesus as Lord.

Starting again at verse 1: "O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water." Here, David is describing his earnest seeking for God and analogizes it with a "dry and weary land where there is no water." We can think easily enough of parched ground in the desert and how it is crying out for water, and how, when given water, it soaks it up quickly. David is using this analogy to describe the seeking of his being, the thirsting of his soul, and the fainting of his flesh. Let's consider each of these:

"Earnestly I seek you." Do you seek God earnestly? Do you seek him at all? In the morning, do you seek him? In your car, do you seek him? At your meals, do you seek him? At your work, or school, or home, do you seek him? With your family, do you seek him? With your friends, do you seek him? Before your enemies, do you seek him? In private, do you seek him? In the prayer closet, do you seek him? In the toil of your day, do you seek him? On your day off, during your Sabbath rest, do you seek him? When you lay your head to rest, do you seek him? Dear Christian, earnestly seek the LORD.

Next, "My soul thirsts for you." Does your soul thirst for God? Does your soul yearn for the bread of Jesus' body and the wine of his blood? Psalm 84:2 reads, "My soul longs, yes, faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God." Does this reflect the thirst of your soul? If it doesn't, do you find yourself satisfied with your abundance in the LORD or are you unaware of your abject need for him? As Jesus preached in his Sermon on the Mount, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied." Dear Christian, be blessed: encourage your soul to thirst for God.

Finally, David writes, "My flesh faints for you." Does your flesh faint for God? As far as spiritual disciplines go, this can be experienced any time we choose to fast. Unfortunately, too many of us, myself included, are woefully inexperienced in this spiritual discipline. By abstaining from physical bread, fasting shows us our spiritual need for the bread of life, of Christ Jesus and his word. In Matthew 4:4, we find that as Jesus was fasting in the desert, he was tempted to make for himself food and responded to Satan by quoting Deuteronomy 8:3 saying, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." Is your flesh faint for God? Consider the spiritual discipline and blessing of fasting.

In all of his seeking, thirsting, and fainting, David feels far from God because of his lot in life. But, David knows his God and so in verse 2 he adds, "So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory." He is seeking God and he knows where to find him: in the sanctuary, exalted in power and glory. When you contemplate God, do you consider his power and glory, his attributes? Or, are your thoughts about God limited to your interaction with him. Do you know him, his character, his nature? Do you behold his power, glory, honor, holiness, justice, wrath, long-suffering, his Trinity, unity, eternality? Dear Christian, seek God by beholding him. Revel in the truth of his nature as revealed in Scripture. Contemplate the Shema of Deuteronomy 6:4: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might." Or consider Exodus 34:6--7:

> "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation."

Dear Christian, earnestly seek God by beholding his power and glory.

Always remember, though you be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus.

## II. Earnestly praise God (vv. 3--4)

Moving to verse 3, David writes, "Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands." David claims to praise God, bless God, and lift up his hands to God as long as he lives *because* God's steadfast love is better than life. God, your love is better than life. Does this truth from David resonate in your heart? His love is better than life. Out of his love he grants life. Out of his love he sent his Son. Out of his love he is merciful to us and has adopted us into his kingdom so that we may live and reign with him forever in the eschaton. Do you praise God out of the abundance of his love? Do you know this love? For those of you who do not know God, hear this: His love is better than life itself. Whatever good you can consider in life, God's love is better, greater, mightier, more effective, and everlasting. As we read earlier in Exodus 34, the LORD is abounding in steadfast love. Do you count yourself a recipient of God's love? Do you praise him on account of his love for you? 

Consider some lyrics from Steve Fee's song, *Your Love is Better than Life*:

> Itâ€™s too high to measure  
Itâ€™s too great a treasure  
Longer than forever  
Itâ€™s inconceivable  

> Itâ€™s big enough to live in  
Itâ€™s deep enough to swim in  
Iâ€™m breathing out just to breath it in  
Itâ€™s overtaken my soul  

> How high  
How deep  
How great is Your love for me  
Itâ€™s making my heart sing  

Dear Christian, earnestly praise God because his love is better than life.

Always remember, though you be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus.

## III. Earnestly cling to God (vv. 5--8)

In the next section, David revels in being satisfied in all the works of God and therefore clings to the God who upholds him. Starting in verse 5: "My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips." Back in verse one we read of David's thirst for God, here we read of David's assurance of what God will do. "My soul *will be satisfied* as with fat and rich food." David knows what the LORD will do for him. Friend, do you trust your God as David did? For those who follow the LORD, he will ultimately deliver us from all sin, all wickedness, all strife, and pain. He will draw us unto himself and create a new heaven and a new earth where there will be no more tears, no more shame, no more sin, death, or pain!

David continues, "And my mouth will praise you with joyful lips, when I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night; for you have been my help." David knows what God will do because he knows what God has done! This God who saved Noah from a worldwide flood, who miraculously rescued the Hebrews out of Egypt, who delivered to the Israelites their inheritance in the land of Canaan, who did many acts in the life of David---David knows and trusts this God because of what he has already done. In the same way, we can further trust God knowing what he has done for us in Christ Jesus. Trust God. Turn to Jesus. Meditate and remember the good works of the LORD. 

Picking up in the middle of verse 7: "And in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy. My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me." David knows that the wings of God will cover and comfort him. This is not so different from his sentiment in Psalm 23:

> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
He makes me lie down in green pastures.  
He leads me beside still waters.  
He restores my soul.  
He leads me in paths of righteousness  
for his name's sake.

> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  
I will fear no evil,  
for you are with me;  
your rod and your staff,  
they comfort me.  

> You prepare a table before me  
in the presence of my enemies;  
you anoint my head with oil;  
my cup overflows.  
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me  
all the days of my life,  
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord
forever.

Returning to Psalm 63:8, "My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me." This is a beautiful picture of the bidirectional relationship we have with God. We must cling to God, however, our clinging is and will always be insufficient. God must uphold us in this relationship. We cling, but he holds. Let me reuse the common metaphor of a child holding her father's hand. When I walk with my 3 year old across the street, she places her hand in mine and clings to me. However, her own grip is insufficient to hold on should she fall. Only by my grip, the holding of a father, can she be safe from falling. Within my hand, she clings, but by my hand, she is secure. In the same way, you must cling to God. You must pursue him. You must love him. You must turn to him. You must use your own effort in your relationship with him. But God is in control. He is the one who upholds you. He gives you life. He gives you breath. He empowers you by the Holy Spirit. He saves. He delivers. He keeps his covenant promises. Cling to God. He will hold you. 

Dear Christian, cling to God; remember, and be satisfied in all his works.

Always remember, though you be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus.

## IV. Earnestly trust God for deliverance  (vv. 9--11)

Starting at verse 9: 

> But those who seek to destroy my life  
shall go down into the depths of the earth;  
they shall be given over to the power of the sword;  
they shall be a portion for jackals.  

Because God appointed David to be King of Israel, all who seek to destroy David are therein enemies of God. If we once more consider God's description of himself in Exodus 36, we know that he is "slow to anger," but "will by no means clear the guilty." Even though he will forgive "iniquity and transgression and sin" he will visit "the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation." How is it that he forgives the iniquity of some, but punishes the iniquity of others? Ultimately, by his mercy, God has chosen to forgive his people who trust in his covenant promises as fulfilled in Christ Jesus. Though all of us deserve punishment for our iniquities, Christ's blood has paid the ransom for sin as realized by all who believe.  Despite this offer of salvation, many, nay most, choose to remain as enemies of God. Read with me, soberly, Paul's account of the fate of the enemies of God. Reading from 2 Thessalonians 2:5--10: 

> This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also sufferingâ€”since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.

Closing in verse 11, David writes, "But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped." David can pray this imprecatory ending to his psalm because his enemies are God's enemies. Ultimately, all of God's enemies will "suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might." Friend, will you suffer that eternal punishment, or will you know God and obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus? Become a friend of God. Receive his mercy and forgiveness. 

Exult the God who will destroy his enemies and stop the mouths of liars. As Moses wrote after the Shema, "It is the LORD your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear" (Deut. 6:13). In the same way, Paul wrote in Romans 14:10--11: "We will all stand before the judgment seat of God; for it is written, 'As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.' So then each of us will give an account of himself to God." When your knee is bowed down before God who will represent you as you give an account? Will it be your imperfect self who deserves nothing but utter destruction in hell? Or will it be Jesus Christ, the Son of God, your Lord, whose righteousness will represent you?

Dear Christian, earnestly trust God for deliverance---the same God who will destroy his enemies and stop the mouths of liars.

Always remember, though you be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus.

# Conclusion

Know this: You can come and rest at the feet of your deliverer, King Jesus. If you do not have a relationship with him, if you cannot say, "O God, you are my God," then I say to you: earnestly seek him. As Jesus said in Matthew 7:7--8, "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened." Seek Jesus; knock on his door. He will reveal himself to you; he will open the door and allow you to pass through the narrow gate into the Kingdom of Heaven. Similarly, God promised in Jeremiah 29:12--14, "Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you."

Dear Christian, though you be weary and heavy laden, seek God, praise him, cling to him, and trust him for your ultimate deliverance in Christ Jesus. Seek God by beholding his power and glory. Praise God because his love is better than life. Cling to God by remembering and being satisfied in all his works. Trust and exult the God who will destroy his enemies and deliver you into Christ Jesus.
