According to Corbett and Fikkert, "Poverty is the result of relationships that do not work, that are not just, that are not for life, that are not harmonious or enjoyable. Poverty is the absence of shalom in all its meanings" (p. 59). Furthermore, material poverty often results in inferiority-complexes; material wealth results in god-complexes. As the authors write, "One of the biggest problems in many poverty-alleviation efforts is that their design and implementation exacerbates the poverty of being of the economically rich---their god-complexes---and the poverty of being of the economically poor---their feelings of inferiority and shame" (p. 62).  Indeed, "It is this lack of freedom to be able to make meaningful choices---to have an ability to affect one's situation---that is the distinguishing feature of poverty" (p. 67).

How can we help the poor while correcting their own view of their own dignity, while also correcting our own tendency to over-value ourselves? How can we instill self-respect, love for others, and diligent work in those who believe they are inferior? These questions were not even in my mind before reading this chapter by Corbett and Fikkert. I cannot imagine effective ways of obtaining these goals outside of the gospel. We rich will view ourselves as better than we ought and the poor will view themselves as worse than they ought until we all realize who we are before God and in Christ. Although the gospel message (alone) will not eradicate systems of injustice, believing that message will give individuals the internal disposition necessary to face life as it comes, trusting in the sovereignty of God, and working hard to overcome challenges. 

Rather than (merely) offering a handout, we should offer our hands up to the Lord who can save both them and us and make all one in Christ. Then we will be able to help best our brother in need as part of the family. Although we are called to help those outside of the family, our priority must always be on those within the family of God. May we grow the family of God and thus grow our responsibility toward others.
