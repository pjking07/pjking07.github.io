_Church Discipline_ is Jonathan Leeman's second entry in the 9Marks: Building Healthy Churches series and is the companion book to _Church Membership_. As the title suggests, Leeman writes in order to promote church discipline in the name of church health and gospel proclamation. However, the author presumes the reader has already been persuaded of the merits of church discipline---the book is a primer for the _practice_ of church discipline. Yet, Leeman's work is not without a theological framework. In part one, the author uses a majority of the text to "establish a theological framework that helps church leaders approach the many different situations they find themselves facing" (18). In part two, Leeman helps the reader judge nine unique case studies based on real discipline scenarios. These case studies are both helpful and necessary in further explaining the "situational nuance" of Leeman's disciplinary framework. The book concludes by briefly noting what a church ought to teach and how it ought to prepare before pursuing its first case of church discipline.

As companion books, both _Church Membership_ and _Church Discipline_ overlap some material.[^A7-1] A side-by-side reading of the books will feel repetitive at times; however, the decision for the repeated passages is understandable since the two books are distinct works, albeit on related topics. Overall, the overlapping material appears to be necessary for each book's argument.

[^A7-1]: E.g., the passage describing the "five purposes of church discipline" is duplicated in both books with slight alterations. _Church Discipline_, 33. Jonathan Leeman, _Church Membership_, 9Marks: Building Healthy Churches (Wheaton: Crossway, 2012), 110.

A common theme in both books is that membership and excommunication are public events. Leeman writes, "[Church discipline] consists of the public statement that [the church] can no longer vouch for an individual's citizenship in heaven" (44). However, neither _Church Membership_ nor _Church Discipline_ explains how the church publicizes either event. Even baptisms rarely comprise public events, considering that they often occur within the walls of a church building. While membership and discipline are official statements of the church and are known among the family of the church, how is the public at large made aware of such declarations? Perhaps 9Marks authors can further explore the public nature of the proclamations of baptism, membership, and discipline in subsequent works.

Building on the public aspect of discipline, part of Leeman's framework requires that excommunicable offenses only be sins that are outward, serious, and unrepentant. Leeman rightly notes that these qualifications are not "theoretically foolproof"; however, they seem prudent given the public nature of excommunication. Notably, the qualification that the sin be a serious one leaves the most room for pastoral and congregational debate. Helpfully, Leeman tempers such debates by adding, "Churches should not excommunicate people whom they believe are Christians" (57). Leaders who keep in mind both Leeman's framework and the affirming goal of church membership ought to guide churches well in cases of discipline.

As pastors recover the gospel vision for church discipline through the ministries of 9Marks and others, they need examples of churches that have been successfully practicing discipline for decades. Therefore, Leeman does well to write to an audience that is already convinced of the necessity of such discipline; this decision allows the _Church Discipline_ to be eminently practical and concise. I know of no better resource on this topic for churches that are ready to begin the biblical practice of church discipline.
