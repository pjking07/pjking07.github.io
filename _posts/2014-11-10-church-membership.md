Jonathan Leeman continues to gain credibility as an authority on local church membership through the pithy _Church Membership_,  his first contribution to the 9Marks: Building Healthy Churches series. Leeman writes to convince ambivalent evangelicals of the importance of local church membership by showing that earthly church  membership is representative of citizenship in the kingdom of heaven. He argues that Jesus passed the apostolic keys to local churches; therefore, Christian churches function as embassies of heaven, officially recognizing on earth those who are citizens of heaven. Thus, God has authorized the local church to represent heaven on earth---to speak for God himself.

Because members constitute local churches, the members together hold the keys of the kingdom. Therefore, Leeman's vision for the church is one in which the church and its members are inextricably linked. Leeman writes, "Church membership . . . is all about a church taking specific responsibility for you, and you for a church" (65). Building upon this foundation, Leeman offers a quick overview to some practical issues of church membership, such as becoming a member, being a member, and acting like a member.

This book's most significant contribution is the author's establishing that the keys of the kingdom belong to the local church. However, this contribution is not without its problems. For instance, after establishing that the apostles received heaven's authority through  the keys of the kingdom (Matt. 16:18--19), Leeman immediately asserts, "[Jesus] indisputably established the church (which _is_ its members), and he gave it the authority of the keys" (59). Leeman rightly develops this assertion by pointing to  Jesus' church discipline prescription in Matthew 18:15--20. However, he leaves much unsaid regarding how these keys were passed from the apostles of old to every local church today. Without further developing this idea, Leeman might fail to convince many readers of who holds the ambassadorial keys of the kingdom.

Although the author presents a strong embassy metaphor for the church, he does not sufficiently develop how such church-embassies are supposed to relate to one another. At most, Leeman likens churches to heavenly embassies established in different locations, serving different people, which works well enough for like-minded churches in diverse geographical contexts. It fails to establish, however, the nature of church relations across denominational lines. Furthermore, while Leeman builds his definition of a church around people making the right gospel confession, he does not develop how churches ought to treat other so-called "churches" that falsely claim to represent the name of Christ. While Leeman establishes that local churches have authority to identify its members as Christians and its excommunicants as non-Christians, he leaves unanswered this question: Who on this earth has the authority to identify churches as representing Christ? Fortunately, these quibbles and questions do not significantly diminish Leeman's thesis or purpose.

One of Leeman's most paradigm-shifting applications of his vision of the local church is that of the Christian living in submission to a local church. Leeman writes, "Just as Christ submitted his whole life for our good, so we should submit our whole lives for one another's good" (95). Leeman then offers eight ways Christians should submit themselves to their local churches---publicly, physically, socially, affectionately, financially, vocationally, ethically, and spiritually. Leeman's definition of a church and its membership liberates the reader to live his Christian life in the context of submission to a local church while participating as a member of that very institution.

Overall, the author's fresh approach to local church membership ought to convince many evangelicals, especially Baptists, of the cosmic significance of that membership. Although Leeman could develop some of this book's themes in subsequent works, _Church Membership_ fulfills its stated purpose. I highly recommend this book to church members of local churches everywhere.
