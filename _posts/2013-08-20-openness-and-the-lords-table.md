There is an ongoing debate about who can properly participate in the Lord's Supper. The first concern is the relationship between the universal and local church in regard to the administration of the Supper. The second concern is the relationship between a Christian's baptism and his ability to participate in the Supper. 

An open view of the Lord's Supper allows for any Christian to participate regardless of his baptismal background. For example, a Presbyterian paedo-baptized Christian would be allowed to partake of the Supper in a Baptist church. This position views the Lord's Supper as "belonging to the Lord" in such a way that no local church should exclude members of the universal church. Although the minority view historically, Charles Spurgeon and John Bunyan both affirmed an open table. This position views the unity of the universal church as a primary concern at the table.

The majority position contends for a less open view of the table. Historically, most Baptists have observed the cracked view in which the table is limited to Christians who have participated in believer's baptism. Some further limit participation to believers who have been baptized into a Baptist church. Under this view, participation in the table is limited by proper participation in Baptism. This position is affirmed by the Baptist Faith and Message. The narrowest position is the closed view in which participation at the table is limited to members of the local church. Within most Baptist contexts, this necessarily limits participation in the Supper to those who have participated in believer's baptism, but does not allow any participation from the external, universal church.

Personally, I prefer a closed table limited to members in good standing. The closed table promotes church discipline, as it is difficult to withhold the Supper in both the open and cracked positions. Ideally, this protects the flock from communing with the unregenerate and protects pastors from administering the elements to people who are bringing condemnation upon themselves. Another benefit to the closed table is the enhancement of Christian community within the local church. A major component of the Lord's Supper is the communal communion with Christ, which is enhanced by intimacy in fellowship with fellow believers. Additionally, I would prefer that the Supper is partaken frequently, as it was in the Early Church. Finally, a closed view of the table communicates a demarcation between the members of a church and the outside world, hopefully enhancing the church's witness to unbelievers.
