Luther's writing on righteousness distinguishes between two types: alien righteousness, which is instilled from without, and proper righteousness, which is worked out from alien righteousness. Luther contends that our original righteousness was lost in Adam but can be replaced by Christ's own righteousness. In particular, this alien righteousness is progressive and not perfected until death. Out of this alien righteousness, "you should be as inclined and disposed toward one another as you see Christ was disposed toward you" (10). 

Reading Luther's essay was encouraging given its topic: our righteousness. Even though Luther reminds us that we must work toward righteousness, he graciously begins with our imputed righteousness from Jesus (even though he incorrectly explains this righteousness as progressive). Also helpful is the outpouring of this righteousness in our own conduct toward neighbor. Just like Christ cast off his form for our sake, Christians must also put off their own form, "and put on the form of those others, praying for their persecutors, blessing those who curse, doing good to evil-doers, prepared to pay the penalty and make satisfaction for their very enemies that they may be saved" (19). 

As a final matter, Luther answers the question, "Is it not permissible to chasten evil man?" He responds with three types of response to evil men: (1) those who seek vengeance, (2) those who do not resist any evil, and (3) those who zealously mete out punishment out of love for justice and for the sake of the offender. While no. 1 is obviously improper, Luther recommends no. 2 and cautions the response of no. 3, "For anger is like zeal, and impatience is like love of justice so that they cannot be sufficiently distinguished except by the most spiritual" (20). His warning against no. 3 reminds me of the epistle in which James writes, "Let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God" (James 1:19--20 [ESV]).  While Jesus expressed his anger and emptied the temple as a perfectly righteous man, he also was slow to anger when perfectly turned the other cheek by giving himself over to death on a cross.
