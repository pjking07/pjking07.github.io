# Main Point of the Text

Jesus taught his disciples that although he is the Messiah, he must first suffer and die. He added that his own disciples must give up their own lives in order to follow him.

# Main Point of the Sermon

Even as Jesus the Christ suffered and died for our sake, so also we must die to self and suffer for Jesus' sake.

# Body

## 1. Jesus, the Messiah, must suffer and die (27--33)

- **Explanation:** The new covenant requires the sacrifice of the suffering servant.
- **Illustration:** Amos 5:18--20; Isaiah 53:10--12; Jer. 31:33.
- **Application:** We must not be confused about who Jesus is. Jesus suffered for the sake of sinners.

## 2. Jesus' followers must die and suffer (34--38)

- **Explanation:** If we are to follow Jesus into new life, we must also follow him into death and suffering.
- **Illustration:** 2 Tim. 1:8–12; 1 Pet. 2:21--24
- **Application:** Expect to suffer for the sake of Christ.
