O the depths of the truth of the Trinity. The Christian God is one God in three persons, blessed Trinity. The Godhead consists of three co-equal persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Each of these persons is God and each has existed eternally as God, being uncreated. Within the Christian context of the Triune God, we can ask ourselves, "What does it mean that God is Father?"

The title of Father is obviously relational, but we must consider to whom God is primarily Father. Far longer than God has been Father to you or to me, God has been Father to the Son. Since before the dawn of time, God the Father has related to God the Son in a fatherly manner. Jesus, the Son of God, revealed his relationship with God the Father through prayers and teaching (e.g. John 17). For example, the will of the Father is ultimate and the Son humbly submits to his Father's perfect will. Furthermore, the Father is the head of the Godhead of whom the other persons are eternally begotten. Because the Father is head, the kingdom of heaven belongs to the Father and the Father chooses those whom belong to the kingdom (cf. John 17:2). 

Significantly, Jesus also shows that the Father loves his creation, the world. Indeed, the Father gave the Son that the world might be saved through him (cf. John 3:17). The Son of God reveals to us that God the Father has chosen to be the Father of a called-out people alongside Jesus. In love, God the Father,  "predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will" (Eph. 1:5 [ESV]). Prior to his ascension, Jesus declared to Mary Magdalene, "I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God" (John 20:17 [ESV]). Through the work of the Son of God we can ourselves become sons of God.

In his mercy, God has provided us with human fathers so they might be a dim reflection of our heavenly Father. Jesus uses the example of earthly fathers to point to the generosity of his Father in giving the Holy Spirit by reminding that even evil men "know how to give good gifts to [their] children" (Luke 11:13 [ESV]). Even more than human fathers, God the Father looks out for his children and provides them with all they need for life and sustenance (cf. Matt. 6:25--33). Furthermore, placing the father as head of the  home reflects the very headship of God the Father. Despite the wickedness in the heart of human fathers, they dimly reflect the reality that God is Father so that we may be prepared to understand the relationship between God the Father and God the Son, and by adoption, between God and ourselves.

As Paul wrote to the Romans, we Christians "have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, 'Abba! Father!' The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs" (Rom. 8:15--17)! God the Father, who has eternally been the Father of the God the Son, has chosen to adopt us as his own children so that we might receive his glorious inheritance. The Father sent the Son to become a man so that we might be restored to life and right relationship with the Father, as his own sons. Let us rejoice with Paul, who wrote, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places" (Eph. 1:3 [ESV])!
