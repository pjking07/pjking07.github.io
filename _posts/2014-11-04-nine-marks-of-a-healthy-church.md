_Nine Marks of a Healthy Church_ is Mark Dever's seminal work on contemporary church health, borne out of his reforming efforts at Capitol Hill Baptist Church. As such, the book is a mere introduction to the view of church health Dever and his compatriots have more thoroughly articulated in numerous books and journals over the past decade. Indeed, the influence of this book and Dever's subsequent writings has firmly established the author and his church's resulting ministry, 9Marks Ministries, as preeminent voices in ecclesiology.

In brief, Dever's nine marks of a healthy church are expositional preaching, biblical theology, a biblical understanding of the gospel, a biblical understanding of conversion, a biblical understanding of evangelism, biblical church membership, biblical church discipline, biblical discipleship, and biblical church leadership. While the author details those particular nine characteristics, he does not attempt to present a comprehensive list of healthy attributes. Rather, he believes that "common errors in these particular nine matters are responsible for so much that goes wrong in our churches," and that additional indicators of a healthy church grow out of these foundational nine (16).

Dever is right to identify expositional preaching as his first and most important mark for a healthy church, because it establishes the priority of the Word of God in the life of the church. As Dever writes, "If you get the priority of the Word established, then you have in place the single most important aspect of the church's life" (39). In fact, I believe readers would have been well served if this mark had been renamed the "Priority of the Word" or the "Centrality of the Word," since there are numerous ways to establish the importance of Scripture, expositional preaching being but one (though the primary) example.

Although some readers quibble with Dever's selected marks, each mark is distinctly important for churches. Dever shows wisdom even in his ordering of these nine attributes: the first ones are most important, and the later ones build upon those that come before. Each mark is inherently founded on the first mark's priority of the Word, and from that flows the biblical theology and understanding of each subsequent mark. For example, one must understand the gospel before he can understand conversion, and one must understand conversion before he can understand evangelism. This building pattern continues throughout the duration of the book.

Because Dever's book establishes many foundational principles for a healthy church, it contains fewer points of direct application than one might expect. In fact, little about the first five marks is inherently ecclesiastical. The book instead attempts to convince the reader of the *necessity* of each mark, so that congregations can first understand the faith they are claiming. One cannot have a Christian church without a biblical understanding of God and the gospel. Once Dever lays this foundation, he addresses more practical matters such as church membership, discipline, discipleship, and leadership. However, even these chapters are more conceptual than applicational.

_Nine Marks of a Healthy Church_ ought to be required reading for anyone seeking an introduction to Mark Dever or 9Marks Ministries. However, those who want detailed discourse regarding each of the marks should explore other materials printed by 9Marks, such as the new _Building Healthy Churches_ series and _The Deliberate Church_ by Mark Dever and Paul Alexander. Regardless, Mark Dever's _Nine Marks of a Healthy Church_ will surely continue to provide a biblical foundation for pastors and churches that wish to grow in ecclesiastical health for years to come.
