My name is PJ King and I read the _Life and Diary of David Brainerd_. My wonderful wife, Katie, is here to help me discuss this important work.

**Katie: So, PJ, give us a light overview of David Brainerd and his book.**

**PJ:** *The Life and Diary of David Brainerd* is a collection of Brainerd's diaries and journals from his adult life. Brainerd himself was a missionary to the American Indians in New England, with whom he experienced great success. Because this book is essentially autobiographical, almost everything I will mention about his past is discussed in this work. However, it is important to begin with this fair warning: David Brainerd spent most of his adulthood suffering from severe depression, tuberculosis, and general ill-health. Jonathan Edwards put it lightly when he wrote "He was, by his constitution and natural temper, so prone to melancholy and dejection of spirit."

**Katie: Can you tell us a little more about the context of Brainerd's life?**

**PJ:** David Brainerd was a contemporary of Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, and John Wesley. Brainerd never made it to the age of 30. He lived from 1718 to 1747 and died in the home of Jonathan Edwards, whose family cared him the final months of his life. He had a long-suffering death, struggling over 7 years with what is now presumed to be tuberculosis. In addition to his health, David Brainerd—indeed, his entire family—had a strong disposition toward depression. To make matters worse, Brainerd lost his father at age 9 and lost his mother at age 14. At 19, Brainerd had a conversion experience, during which he realized he had been trusting in his duties, and not in the glory of God. His conversion, however, did not cure him of his ailments.

**Katie: Could you enlighten us as to the format of *The Life and Diary of David Brainerd*?**

**PJ:** *The Life and Diary* is essentially made of three parts: (1) a short autobiography through Brainerd's time at Yale, (2) a personal diary, and (3) a journal which Brainerd kept for his missions agency. The journal portion of this work was originally published independently. However, Jonathan Edwards, after getting to know Brainerd so thoroughly, decided that it would profitable to publish the private diaries as supplements to the Journal. However, there are no published diary entries during the time period of the Journal (one year), so the Journal is sandwiched between the diaries. Because the Journal was written with the intention of public distribution, it references little of Brainerd's state of mind. However, his personal diaries allow us to take a look at the turmoil through which Brainerd was going much of his life.

**Katie: Tell us something about David Brainerd's time at Yale**

**PJ:** Brainerd was so very excited to attend Yale. In his second year, however, he started falling ill—this appears to have been the beginning of his 7 year long bout with tuberculosis. Brainerd longed for liberal education—and wanted to become a minister. At the time, there was a law requiring a degree from Harvard or Yale in order to become a minister. So it is most pitiable that David Brainerd was expelled from Yale during his third year.

**Katie: He was expelled??**

**PJ:** I must say, his expulsion was a bit over the top. At the time there was a great hubbub amongst the younger people about a *Great Awakening*. In fact, many students were so zealous about their own Awakenings that they began charging others, particularly their superiors, as being unregenerate. In response, there was a rule set at Yale expelling students for making such accusations. It was in this context that Brainerd made a private and seemingly innocuous comment about his tutor saying, "he has no more grace than this chair." For that, David Brainerd was expelled from Yale. Brainerd actually apologized profusely, and even attended the graduation of his former classmates. Yale eventually accepted his apology, even extending an offer to return, however, by that time, Brainerd had found a calling different from that of a minister. Notably, there is a building at Yale now named after David Brainerd.

**Katie: You said that Brainerd had a new calling than that of a minister, could you explain what you mean?**

**PJ:** Well, after Brainerd was expelled from Yale, he struggled mightily to determine the course of his life, because he would not be allowed to become a minister—indeed, he cried out to God for ministerial qualifications. It was within this context that he came across the opportunity to become a missionary to the American Indians, sent by the Scottish Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. In fact, it is because of his work and success among the Indians that Brainerd is remembered today.

**Katie: Was David Brainerd still struggling with depression when he began his mission to the Indians?**

**PJ:** Mightily. Brainerd was consistently writing about his dejected spirit for the first 3 years of his ministry. (Correspondingly, this was not a particularly fruitful time for his mission.) One thing I noted is that while he was depressed, Brainerd would frame his depression in theological terms, however, on his good days, he would rightly identify the other days as ‘dejection of spirit.' He often wrote of his overwhelming sense of vileness, and would list sins of the heart which may not have been true. To speak to the consistency of his depression: early in his ministry, it was a big deal when he went for a whole week without suffering from dejection. You have to realize, however, that Brainerd didn't have any kind of consistent Christian companionship during these early years. Thankfully, the veil of his depression was largely lifted at the time of his success among the Indians. Although we he was not ever fully free, he was able to have a clear mind most of the time from then until his death.

**Katie: Did you find such reading difficult?**

**PJ:** Indeed, Brainerd was so thoroughly depressed during his early ministry that I had great difficultly reading the book. There were days I just couldn't emotionally handle his drama. Half of the book takes place before his missionary successes, so I just kept reading and reading, thinking to myself, "Does he ever snap out of this?" Because of this, it actually took me months to get through the book. Jonathan Edwards omitted some of David Brainerd's most dejected entries, so I know it could have been even worse!

**Katie: What positive aspects were there to reading Brainerd's personal diary?**

**PJ:** David Brainerd was a man of prayer. He rarely wrote prayers in his diary, but he often discussed his time of prayer. Not uncommonly, he would spend an entire day in the woods, by himself, in prayer. He prayed "that God might be known to be God in the whole earth." One time he wrote that he "was enabled to wrestle with God by prayer in a more affectionate, fervent, humble, intense, and importunate manner than I have for many months past." David Brainerd seemed to pray frequently and fervently, which was a great encouragement to me.

Additionally, I found it beneficial to read through his depression for two reasons: (1) to better understand others who are suffering and (2) to admire his personal efforts for the ministry even through incredibly difficult circumstances.

**Katie: Let's move on to Brainerd's mission with the Indians. What was his time like with the natives?**

**PJ:** David Brainerd spent 4 years as a missionary to the Native Americans in New England. His first 3 years were extremely difficult and seemed fruitless. He was struggling with depression and was consistently ill, the Indians were largely unresponsive or hostile to his work, and he had run-ins with a few anti-missionizing whites, who would have rather taken advantage of the Indians, than show them Jesus. During these years, he traveled around to different groups of Indians and seemed to not be able to find success.

**Katie: Did he ever want to quit?**

**PJ:** Brainerd did consider quitting, he even stated that he was ready to quit just as his success came. However, it is notable that during this early time, he was extended multiple offers to become a minister at different churches, including one in the rich East Hamptons. You have to remember that becoming a minister, and not a missionary, was his original goal in life—and yet he turned down all of the offers.

**Katie: But he did find success…**

**PJ:** He did. In fact, he had immediate success with a group of Indians at Crossweeksung in New Jersey. Through the grace of God, Brainerd was able to start a church which grew to 130 in the first year. This period of time also included the one year of his public journal for the Scottish Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge and would end up being his last year as a missionary.

For perhaps the first time, the Indians at Crossweeksung did not oppose Brainerd's initial preaching. In fact, some women were so excited by his first sermon that they traveled 15 miles to bring their friends the next day. On the first day, he preached to 8 individuals. By the third day, 30 were coming to hear his sermons and within two weeks, the crowd had gathered to 50, at two months there were 65 people, and at three months, 95. By the end of the first year, the church among the Crossweeksung included 130 believing natives.

**Katie: It's amazing there was that kind of rapid success, despite the language barrier.**

**PJ:** It truly is. Brainerd was not fluent in the multiple native languages of the area, so all of his sermons were actually through a translator. So, despite the poor means of communication, these Indians were willingly hearing the gospel. What's even greater is that, for Brainerd's first 6 months at Crossweeksung, his translator wasn't even a believer! He was just a guy who knew English. Unsurprisingly, the translator and his wife were the first to be baptized among this group.

**Katie: Was there anything that Brainerd learned during his success in missionizing this group?**

**PJ:** The most significant learning point for Brainerd was that the people were far more influenced by the joys of heaven and knowing Christ, than the terrors of hell. Indeed, he was surprised that it was so. Let me read to you some quotes from his journal:

> It was surprising to see how their hearts seemed to be pierced with the tender and melting invitations of the gospel, when there was not a word of terror spoken to them.
>
> . . .
>
> But still, this great awakening, this surprising concern, was never excited by any harangues of terror, but always appeared most remarkable when I insisted upon the compassions of a dying Savior, the plentiful provisions of the gospel, and the fee offers of divine grace to needy distressed sinners.
>
> . . .
>
> Explained and insisted upon the story of the rich man and Lazarus. The Word made powerful impressions upon many in the assembly, especially while I discoursed of the blessedness of "Lazarus in Abraham's bosom." This, I could perceive, affected them much more than what I spoke of the rich man's misery and torments. And this it has been usually with them. They have almost always appeared much more affected with the comfortable than the dreadful truths of God's Word. That which has distressed many of them under conviction is, that they found they wanted, and could not obtain, the happiness of the godly. At least, they have often appeared to be more affected with this than with the terrors of hell.

**Katie: But his success did not last long?**

**PJ:** As I mentioned before, David Brainerd had a long-suffering bout with tuberculosis. Following this successful year at Crossweeksung, his health took a turn for the worse, forcing him eventually to return to civilization. He spent some time in proximity to his new people, but eventually moved in with the Edwards family for his final months.

**Katie: How did he seem to handle this turn in life?**

**PJ:** Brainerd wrote that he was most pained that his congregation no longer had a pastor. Thankfully, his own brother would eventually continue David's work. Although, Brainerd still suffered from mild depression at times, he was not caught up in his state. His writing indicated that he had been sick so long, and had toiled so much, that he was simply ready to go home and receive his inheritance. It is notable that his want of death during this time *was not* related to his depression, but truly did seem to come from readiness.

**Katie: I've heard David Brainerd's name often in missions circles. Why is he so popular?**

**PJ:** I think John Piper said it best in one of his sermons:

> Why has Brainerd's life made the impact that it has? One obvious reason is that Jonathan Edwards took the Diaries and published them as a *Life of Brainerd* in 1749. But why has this book never been out of print? Why did John Wesley say, "Let every preacher read carefully over the 'Life of Brainerd'"? Why was it written of Henry Martyn that "perusing the life of David Brainerd, his soul was filled with a holy emulation of that extraordinary man; and after deep consideration and fervent prayer, he was at length fixed in a resolution to imitate his example"? Why did William Carey regard Edwards' *Life of Brainerd* as a sacred text? Why did Robert Morrison and Robert McCheyne of Scotland and John Mills of America and Frederick Schwartz of Germany and David Livingston of England and Andrew Murray of South Africa and Jim Elliot of modern America look upon Brainerd with a kind of awe and draw power from him the way they and countless others did?
>
> The answer for me is that Brainerd's life is a vivid, powerful testimony to the truth that God can and does use weak, sick, discouraged, beat-down, lonely, struggling saints, who cry to him day and night, to accomplish amazing things for his glory. —[John Piper, "Oh, That I May Never Loiter On My Heavenly Journey!"](http://www.desiringgod.org/biographies/oh-that-i-may-never-loiter-on-my-heavenly-journey)

Piper just dropped a lot of big names of people who were impacted by David Brainerd. Despite Brainerd's shortcomings---no, because of them---he has had a great influence on our modern view of missions. He gave his life serving people whom the common man saw as either an enemy or a fool. It is because of Brainerd's missionary success that his story is *known*, but it is because of his mighty struggles that his story is *loved*.
