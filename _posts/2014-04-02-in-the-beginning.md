"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"---so begins the biblical narrative and the story of God reconciling the world to himself. The  Bible begins with God at the beginning of time and ends with God at the end of time. The Bible begins with God creating a good land for good people to inhabit and ends with him recreating a perfect earth with perfected inhabitants. The Bible begins in the beginning, at creation, because that is the beginning of our story with God, the creator of all.

Without a proper understanding of God at work in creation, we would misinterpret God at work in history. Indeed, it is through creation, as the Creator, that God establishes his power, rule, and authority over all. Without a creation narrative, God would be entering into a pre-existent world. In such a scenario, this God may be supernatural and greater than all beings, but he would not be known as the creator, owner, initiator, sustainer, and ruler of all creation. If, having not created the world, God  attempted to establish his authority over the world, he would be seen as a usurper and conqueror---a brute. Therefore, the beginning of the story of God reconciling the world to himself ought to be God's act in creating the world.

Furthermore, without a creation narrative, we would not know how we ought to relate to this supernatural being. If he did not create us and does not possess ownership of us, then why should we trust him to be willing and able to take care of us? In the same way a child ought not to trust a stranger for shelter, food, and love, we humans should scarcely trust a supernatural being who enters our world, interjects himself, and claims status as king over all, worthy of being obeyed, capable of doing anything. Our God has not interjected himself into our world like Loki; he is properly king and judge because he is creator.

The creation narrative properly begins the Scripture because it is essential to the rest of the story of the Bible. However, creation is not the essence of the gospel. While creation and a creating God are prerequisite to the gospel such a creative beginning could lead to different meta-narratives than the Christian gospel. Although a creator God does not necessitate a saving God, a creator God is necessary for a saving God. Indeed, a creating God must be presupposed in order for the story of salvation to have merit. 

On its own, the creation narrative does not explain the gospel narrative. Indeed, only after one has understood and believed the gospel message can one truly appreciate the creation narrative for what it is. In the same way, *The Magician's Nephew* only makes proper sense after one has read *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe* and the other books of the *Chronicles of Narnia.* Without having read the other books in the series, *The Magician's Nephew* is a prequel to an unknown work, building up to an unknown story. Much of the creative work of Aslan (such as the placing of the lamppost) is a precursor of the story to come. The beginning only makes full sense after one understands the whole story. 

So it is with God's story. We must begin the gospel story with the Creator God and the creation narrative, but we will not understand the creation story until it is read in light of the whole gospel. The creation narrative is where we must begin, but we must not remain there. This Creator God is also Judge, King, Savior, and Redeemer. Therefore, let us bask in the whole story of the gospel.
