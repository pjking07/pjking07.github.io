# Introduction

The theology of marriage is an ever-pertinent topic for the
modern church. A variety of Christian opinions exist regarding this
topic, not least because of the difficulty found in interpreting and
systematizing the relevant biblical evidence.[^1] For example, some argue
that marriage is permanently binding and all divorces are ineffective,
i.e., anyone who "divorces and remarries" is still married to his or her
original spouse and is living a rebellious life of adultery.[^2] Others
affirm that only invalid divorces lead to adultery, while valid divorces
do not.[^3] However, I believe both of these positions err in their view of
the efficacy of divorce. Therefore, despite the ideal of the
indissolubility of marriage, I will demonstrate that marriage in a
fallen world is effectively dissolved by both death and divorce.

[^1]: E.g., one book debates four views on divorce and remarriage: (1) no divorce and no remarriage, (2) divorce but no remarriage, (3) divorce and remarriage for adultery or desertion, (4) divorce and remarriage under a variety of circumstances. H. Wayne House, ed., *Divorce and Remarriage: Four Christian Views* (Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 1990).

[^2]: I have had much interaction with casualties of this position via my own series on divorce and remarriage for my former online magazine, *Pillar on the Rock*. However, some who hold to a permanence view of marriage do not arrive at the same conclusion regarding remarriage, e.g., Daryl Wingerd et al., *Divorce and Remarriage: A Permanence View* (Kansas City, MO: Christian Communicators Worldwide, 2009), 105. Wingerd et al. affirm the permanence of marriage, but insist the adultery in view is a one-time event occurring at the initiation of the new marriage.

# The Indissoluble Ideal of Marriage

One purpose of marriage is to fill the earth (Gen. 1:28). Marriage
mysteriously represents the relationship of Christ and the Church (Eph.
5:32), but also serves the needs of human reproduction and child
rearing. Therefore, marriage is a common gift to mankind, regardless of
one's orientation toward the Giver (cf. Luke 17:27). Marriage is
defined, prescribed, and idealized as a "lifelong, faithful union of a
man and a woman."[^4] Thus, any discussion regarding the biblical view of
divorce ought first to begin with the biblical view of marriage itself.[^5]

Andrew Cornes helpfully formulates the emergent features of marriage:
consent, permanence, public witness, and sexual union. Cornes finds the
necessity of consent in the narration of Isaac's betrothal to Rebekah
(Gen. 24:1--8, 57). Regarding permanence, he equates "vow" with a solemn
oath or covenant, citing the wedding of God to Israel (Ezek. 16:8).
Furthermore, Cornes considers public witness to be essential, especially
that of the ultimate witness, God himself (cf. Gen. 34:11; Mal. 2:14).
Finally, seizing the metaphor of the one-flesh union, Cornes regards
sexual consummation as necessary for marriage.[^6] Cornes' analysis proves
helpful in identifying the qualities of marriage, even marriage found
outside the Church. As Cornes himself concludes, "God joins together
every couple in every valid marriage. He has been doing so, according to
Christ, since 'the beginning of creation' (Mark 10:5--9; Matt. 19:4--8)."[^7]

## Two Shall Become One

A proper understanding of God-ordained marriage begins in the creation
account: "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold
fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh" (Gen. 2:24, ESV).
While "one flesh" is a euphemism for the sexual relationship in marriage
(1 Cor. 6:16), it also pronounces mutual ownership within marriage (1
Cor. 7:4) and provides an impetus for love between spouses (Eph. 5:33).
Helpfully, both Jesus and Paul use the one-flesh metaphor as part of
their theology of marriage.

### Matthew 19:4--6

Jesus explains God's original ideal of indissoluble marriage in a
confrontation with the Pharisees. Attempting to test him, the Pharisees
ask Jesus, "Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?" (Matt.
19:3, ESV).[^8] Jesus responds, "Have you not read that he who created them
from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'Therefore a man
shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the
two shall become one flesh'? So they are no longer two but one flesh.
What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate" (Matt.
19:4-6, ESV).

[^8]: Mark 10:2 uses a shorter question: "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" (ESV).

Alluding to Genesis 1:27,[^9] Jesus harkens to God's original, perfect
creation. Man and woman, made in the image of God, were blessed with
marriage and given the task to fill the earth (Gen. 1:27--31). Jesus then
reminds his hearers of the one-flesh union between husband and wife (cf.
Gen. 2:24). In the creation account, the pronouncement of the one-flesh
union was preceded by God's declaration, "It is not good that the man
should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him" (Gen. 2:18, ESV)
and Adam's song of love for his newly created bride (Gen. 2:23). By
citing the creation account, Jesus affirms marriage as a union between
one man and one woman and commands man to not separate such a union.
Therefore, Jesus affirms the ideal of faithful, monogamous, loving, and
indissoluble marriage.

 [^9]: In the Markan parallel, Jesus directly quotes Gen. 1:27 (Mark 10:6).

### Ephesians 5:22--33

In his epistle to the Ephesians, Paul instructs his hearers about the
purpose of marriage. He teaches husbands to love their wives and wives
to respect and submit to their husbands (Eph. 5:24). Following, Paul
cites the metaphor of the one-flesh union (cf. Gen. 2:24) in order to
reveal how marriage ought to function in love and reflect the
relationship of Christ and the Church. Paul writes, "In the same way
husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his
wife loves himself" (Eph. 5:28, ESV). Because the husband and wife are
of one figurative body, they ought to love each other as they love their
own individual bodies. Ultimately, Paul concludes, "This mystery is
profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.
However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife
see that she respects her husband" (Eph. 5:32--33, ESV). The one-flesh
union between husband and wife is a tangible reflection of the
relationship between Christ and the Christ. Damaging or destroying human
marriages diminishes this didactic purpose of marriage.

## Sexual Immorality within Marriage

Because of sin and the fall, marriages will experience various degrees
of sexual immorality. In an attempt to interpret the exceptive clauses
of Matthew 5:32 and 19:9, some have argued that sexual immorality,
especially adultery, intrinsically dissolves marriage.[^10] Despite the
sinfulness of sexual immorality, the biblical evidence demonstrates that
"infidelity does not by itself dissolve a marriage."[^11]

[^10]: James M. Weibling, "Reconciling Matthew and Mark on Divorce," *Trinity Journal* 22, no. 2 (September 1, 2001): 227, accessed October 7, 2013, *ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials,* EBSCO*host*. Weibling writes against the view that sexual immorality alone dissolves a marriage.

### Matthew 5:27--28

Marriage was designed by God to be a reflection of the union between
Christ and his bride, the Church. David Jones rightly concludes, "Any
violation of the husband-wife relationship will metaphorically impact
the integrity of the Christ-church relationship."[^12] Although a serious
offense against God and spouse, sexual immorality does not inherently
dissolve a marriage between a man and a woman. This is especially true
given Jesus' interpretation of the commandment, "You shall not commit
adultery," as, "Everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has
already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matt. 5:27--28, ESV).
If adultery (including lust) tacitly severs a marriage relationship,
then one may presume that all marriages involving sinful men and women
have already been so severed. Therefore, by *reductio ad absurdum*,
sexual immorality alone does not dissolve marriage.

[^12]: David W. Jones, *An Introduction to Biblical Ethics* (Nashville: B&H, 2013), Kindle locations 3950–3951.

### Hosea and Gomer

The story of Hosea and Gomer further demonstrates that sexual immorality
does not implicitly end a marriage. Indeed, God commanded Hosea, "Go,
take to yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for
the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the LORD" (Hos. 1:2, ESV).
Subsequent to their wedding, Gomer once again prostituted herself.
Despite her sexual infidelity, Gomer appears to remain married to Hosea,[^13]
who is called by God to redeem her. The LORD says to Hosea, "Go again,
love a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, even as
the LORD loves the children of Israel" (Hos. 3:1, ESV). Hosea's
faithfulness to Gomer, despite her infidelity, represents the LORD's
faithfulness to Israel, despite its infidelity.

[^13]: Granted, this is not abundantly clear from the text, especially Hosea 2:2. However, there is no mention of any certificate of divorce or divorce proceedings. Furthermore, Hosea 2:3 appears to *threaten* divorce or death. J. Andrew Dearman notes, "The marriage is broken *de facto*; has it been severed *de jure*? … It seems that for a time Hosea still engages Gomer in the hope that she can be convinced of the error of her ways." J. Andrew Dearman, *The Book of Hosea*, New International Commentary on the Old Testament (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 2010), 109; Contra David Instone-Brewer, *Divorce and Remarriage in the Bible: The Social and Literary Context* (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 2002), 37.

### David and Bathsheba

Finally, the account of David's adulterous relationship with Bathsheba
also serves the point that infidelity does not constitute the
dissolution of a marriage. As known from the sinful, yet popular story
found in 2 Samuel 11--12, David lustfully eyed Bathsheba while she was
bathing. Although Bathsheba was married to Uriah the Hittite, David
called her to his chamber for what appeared to be a single adulterous
indulgence. However, Bathsheba conceived a child by David while her
husband was at war. David then attempted to cover up his adulterous
affair by enticing Uriah to return home and be with his wife, but Uriah
unwittingly refused. Subsequently, David sent Uriah back to the front
lines of war with instructions for his commander to ensure Uriah's death
in battle. Once David knew of Uriah's death, he took Bathsheba as his
wife, "but the thing that David had done displeased the LORD" (2 Sam.
11:26, ESV). Significantly, Bathsheba did not become David's wife by her
adultery, nor was she implicitly divorced from Uriah by the same act.
David went to great lengths to hide his adulterous rendezvous with
Bathsheba, showing that his sexual immorality neither ended her existing
marriage nor created a new one.

### 1 Corinthians 6:15--20

While Paul describes marriage in terms of a one-flesh union, he uses the
same metaphor to describe relations with a prostitute.[^14] Paul writes to
the Corinthians, "Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute
becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, 'The two will become
one flesh'" (1 Cor. 6:16, ESV). Paul uses the intensity of the one-flesh
union to urge the Corinthians to "flee from sexual immorality" (1 Cor.
6:18, ESV). He further affirms, "Your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit within you, whom you have with God" (1 Cor. 6:19, ESV). Because a
Christian's body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, sexual immorality
creates a one-flesh union between the temple of God and a prostitute---may
it never be! However, by Paul, this one-flesh union is not associated
with marriage; such a union does not create a marriage on its own.[^15] While
fornication, prostitution, and adultery will offend current marriages
(and God himself), these sins will not mysteriously begin new marriages.

If space allowed, other arguments could be made in support of the
persistence of marriage despite sexual infidelity.[^16] Although sexual
immorality is grave and has serious consequences for all involved, the
biblical evidence shows that infidelity does not implicitly dissolve a
marriage. Any view of marriage that supposes *de facto* divorce on
account of sexual immorality does not appear to have footing in the
biblical text.

[^16]: E.g., Joseph's contemplation to divorce Mary subsequent to her perceived infidelity (Matt. 1:19); the necessity of a certificate of divorce in Judaic practice (Deut. 24:1); Jesus' response to the woman caught in adultery (John 8:11); Reuben's adultery with Bilhah (Gen. 35:22). Note: some of the preceding examples of adultery come from Köstenberger and Jones, 35.

# Dissolution of the Indissoluble Ideal

When the Pharisees tested Jesus about the right to divorce, Jesus
responded by teaching the ideal of the indissolubility of marriage
(Matt. 19:4--6). Despite good intentions, modern discussions of marriage
can similarly devolve, so that "we are asking the question in much the
same way as the Pharisees: we want to know when we *may* divorce, not
when we may not."[^17] Unfortunately, a full discussion about marriage must
include an evaluation of its dissolution. The following will detail the
dissolution of marriage, despite the ideal of its indissolubility.

[^17]: Cornes, 297.

## Death Dissolves Marriage

Scripture consistently affirms the effective dissolution of marriage by
death. If one assumes Adam and Eve were intended never to die, then
their original, perfect marriage would have never been ended by their
own deaths. Without sin, their marriage would not merely have been for
life---it would have been everlasting! However, because of sin and the
fall, every marriage will eventually break the indissoluble ideal, even
if only by the death of a spouse.

### Matthew 22:23--33

In an attempt to deny the resurrection, the Sadducees tested Jesus by
asking him a hypothetical question about a widow involved in levirate
marriage. In their contrived scenario, a woman married the first of
seven brothers, but her husband died, leaving no offspring. Following
the tradition of levirate marriage, the widow married the second
brother, who also died with no offspring. This process continued until
she finally married the seventh brother, who died and also left no
offspring. The Sadducees asked Jesus, "In the resurrection, therefore,
of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her" (Matt.
22:28, ESV). Jesus responded, "You are wrong, … for in the resurrection
they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in
heaven" (Matt. 22:29--30, ESV). Although Jesus was responding to a
question about the resurrection, he also provided instruction about the
dissolution of marriage by death.[^18] Both at the time of her death and at
the resurrection, Jesus considers the widow to be married to none of her
prior husbands---not the first, not the last. Therefore, despite the ideal
of the indissolubility of marriage, each of the widow's seven serial
marriages was effectively terminated by the death of the husband.[^19]

[^18]: David Platt, *Exalting Jesus in Matthew*, Christ-Centered Exposition (Nashville: B&H, 2013), 293.

[^19]: While it is possible that the law of levirate marriage made this case exceptional, other biblical teachings will show no such exception.

### Romans 7:2--3

In his epistle to the Romans, Paul teaches, "The law is binding on a
person only as long as he lives" (Rom. 7:1, ESV). Paul then explains
that Christians are "released from the law" through the death of Christ
so that they may "serve in the new way of the Spirit" (Rom. 7:6, ESV).
To serve his point, Paul uses the law of marriage as an illustration,
writing, "For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he
lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage"
(Rom. 7:2, ESV). Therefore, marriage is dissolved by the death of one
spouse. Furthermore, the surviving wife is "free from that law, and if
she marries another man she is not an adulteress" (Rom. 7:3, ESV). Paul
not only teaches that death functionally ends a marriage; he teaches
that death totally dissolves the marriage, giving the surviving spouse
the option to legally and morally remarry.

### 1 Corinthians 7:39

In his first canonical epistle to the Corinthians, Paul responds to
questions about marriage and celibacy. While conceding that singleness
is a gift from God (1 Cor. 7:7), Paul urges the Corinthians to remain in
their current condition (1 Cor. 7:24), but permits the unmarried and
widows to marry "if they cannot exercise self-control" (1 Cor. 7:9,
ESV). Following a lengthy discussion on the options before the
unmarried, betrothed, and widowed, Paul writes, "A wife is bound to her
husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be
married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord" (1 Cor. 7:39, ESV). This
instruction is similar to that in his Roman epistle (above). As Cornes
rightly concludes, "This is the clearest, and most straightforward,
statement in the New Testament about the options open to a person after
the death of her or his partner."[^20]

[^20]: Cornes, 262.

The above passages demonstrate that death effectively dissolves
marriage. Furthermore, such dissolution brings with it the option to
remarry in the Lord. Paul urges those who can receive the blessing of
singleness to remain as they are, but acknowledges the moral and legal
option for the widow (and, presumably, the widower) to remarry
subsequent to the dissolution of her marriage by death.

## Divorce Dissolves Marriage

In the present world, marriage too often falls short of the indissoluble
ideal commanded by Jesus. Through the sin of one or both spouses,
marriages tragically continue to end in divorce, thus falling short of
Jesus' indissoluble ideal. In his classic work on divorce, John Murray
rightly notes, "Divorce is contrary to the divine institution, contrary
to the nature of marriage, and contrary to the divine action by which
the union is effected. It is precisely here that its wickedness becomes
singularly apparent---it is the sundering by man of a union God has
constituted. Divorce is the breaking of a seal which has been engraven
by the hand of God."[^21] Regarding the pain of divorce, Larry Richards
writes, "God's goal in giving marriage to man was to build, not to tear
down. To create a supportive union, not destructive isolation. And no
divorce can avoid just this kind of anguish."[^22] As discussed above,
Scripture teaches that death dissolves marriage. Following, the biblical
evidence will also demonstrate that divorce is effective at dissolving
marriage, regardless of the morality of the divorce.

### Deuteronomy 24:1--4

Many words have been spent elsewhere analyzing the divorce law found in
Deuteronomy 24:1--4.[^23] However, this passage also demonstrates the
effectiveness of divorce. In the first divorce, the man "has found some
indecency" in his wife, so "he writes her a certificate of divorce and
puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, and she departs out
of his house" (Deut. 24:1, ESV). The certificate demonstrates the
divorce was legal and the language ("some indecency") shows that the
divorce was justified. A second divorce is also in view: after the woman
is divorced from her first husband, "she goes and becomes another man's
wife, and the latter man hates her and writes her a certificate of
divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house" (Deut.
24:2--3, ESV). While this divorce also follows the legal divorce process,
the language ("hates her") describes an unjustified divorce.[^24] Therefore,
the two divorces, justified and unjustified, were both legally effective
at ending the marriage of the woman, regardless of the supposed morality
of each.[^25]

[^24]: Heth, "Remarriage for Adultery or Desertion," 65–66. Heth interprets this text as distinguishing between justified and unjustified divorce. For more on ancient divorce practices in Israel, especially regarding the justification for divorce, see David Janzen, "The meaning of *porneia* in Matthew 5.32 and 19.9: an approach from the study of ancient Near Eastern culture," *Journal for the Study of the New Testament*, no. 80 (December 1, 2000): 66-80, accessed October 7, 2013, *ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials,* EBSCO*host*.

[^25]: Contra "Neither the divorce procedure that was practiced by Israel nor the purely lexical meaning of a single word in Deuteronomy 24:1 can establish the claim that the nature of a 'biblical' divorce is that it completely dissolves the marriage bond." Heth, "Divorce, but No Remarriage," in House, 83.

### Ezra 9--10

During the restoration of Jerusalem, the prophet Ezra became aware that
the people of Israel had "not separated themselves from the peoples of
the lands with their abominations, … for they have taken some of their
daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons" (Ezra 9:1--2,
ESV). Intermarriage between Israel and the Canaanites had been expressly
forbidden by God: "You shall not intermarry with them, giving your
daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons, for
they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods"
(Deut. 7:3--4, ESV). Thus, Ezra responded with repentance, mourning, and
fear of the LORD (Ezra 9:7). Ezra and the people then covenanted with
God to "put away all these wives and their children" (Ezra 10:3, ESV).

The "putting away" of the foreign wives ought to be viewed as equivalent
to divorce.[^26] This can be interpreted from Isaiah 50:1, which couples a
certificate of divorce with the sending away of a wife.[^27] By sending away
the foreign wives, Ezra effectively terminated the marriages in question
so that the fierce wrath of God over this matter was turned away (Ezra
10:15). Divorce was demanded in this situation because the consummated
marriages were immoral before the LORD. However, the marriages were
valid and thus required an effective divorce in order to dissolve the
immoral relationship.[^28]

[^26]: Luck, 79; Contra J. Carl Laney, "No Divorce & No Remarriage," in House, 26.


[^27]: "Where is your mother's certificate of divorce, with which I sent her away?" (Isaiah 50:1, ESV).


[^28]: Cornes, 161.


### John 4:17--18

In Jesus' discussion with the Samaritan woman at the well, he
demonstrates his messiahship by acutely diagnosing her marital
situation. After Jesus asks her to call her husband, the woman asserts
that she has no husband. Displaying his omniscience, Jesus responds,
"You are right in saying, 'I have no husband'; for you have had five
husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have
said is true" (John 4:17--18, ESV). Jesus' indictment of the woman is
two-fold: she is currently with a man who is not her husband and she has
serially married five men. While the purpose of this passage is to
reveal Jesus as Messiah, one can observe within this passage important
assumptions Jesus makes regarding the dissolubility of marriage.

Craig Keener notes the significance of this passage, explaining, "Jesus
does not say to the woman at the well, 'You were married once and have
lived with five men since then.' Rather, he says, 'you were married five
times but are just living with someone now.'"[^29] Considering Jesus'
intention to reveal the woman's sin, it would be difficult to presume
that all of these marriages ended by the death of the husband. If she
were merely a widow, subsequent marriages would not have been immoral.
Furthermore, Jesus affirms the validity of the woman's statement, "I
have no husband." His attestation demonstrates that the Samaritan
woman's prior marriages were each effectively terminated. In no way is
she still married to any husband---not the first, not the last. If her
marriages were not all ended by death, then one may presume that they
were ended by divorce. Hence, Jesus seems to affirm that divorce
effectively dissolves marriage.

[^29]: Craig S. Keener, "Remarriage for Circumstances beyond Adultery or Desertion," in Strauss, 107.

### Mark 10:9

Concluding his testing before the Pharisees, Jesus commanded, "What
therefore God has joined together, let not man separate" (Mark 10:9,
ESV). While Jesus teaches the ideal of the indissolubility of marriage,
he does not teach that marriage in a sinful world is functionally
indissoluble.[^30] His final phrase, "let not man separate," speaks to the
morality, not the efficacy of divorce.[^31] Jesus is calling for fidelity and
commitment in marriage, but he is not removing the sinful possibility of
divorce. While acknowledging the immorality of divorce, he does not
abrogate its function. Therefore, divorce still exists in a fallen
world, presumably for the same reason it did under Moses: "Because of
your hardness of heart" (Mark 10:4, ESV).[^32]

## "Invalid" Divorce

Across the spectrum of positions on divorce and remarriage, various
scholars label improper divorces (however designated) as "invalid".[^33] This
labeling comes from a literalistic interpretation of Jesus' charge of
adultery against (some of?) those who divorce and remarry (Matt. 5:32,
19:9; Mark 10:11--12; Luke 16:18).[^34] By this view, the adultery resulting
from remarriage is caused by an invalid (ineffective) divorce.
Instone-Brewer explains the position: "The solution that almost all
commentators have found is to assume that the divorce was invalid. This
solution works very well, because if the divorce was invalid, the person
was still legally married to the first partner, so the second marriage
was adulterous."[^35]

[^33]: E.g., Heth, "Remarriage for Adultery or Desertion," 77; Keener, "A Response to Gordon J. Wenham," in Strauss, 51; Instone-Brewer, 149, 178.


[^34]: E.g., Instone-Brewer reasons, "A person who has legally divorced and legally remarried, might be called inconstant or immoral, but he cannot be called an adulterer." Instone-Brewer, 149.


[^35]: Instone-Brewer, 149.


However, a literalistic interpretation of Jesus' charge of adultery may
not be necessary. Craig Keener suggests that, just as Jesus uses
hyperbole when "commanding" one to tear out his eye and cut off his hand
in order to avoid sin, he uses the same rhetorical device to describe
the sin of divorcing one's wife and marrying another (Matt. 5:29--32).
Furthermore, "Jesus not only calls remarriage 'adultery' in 5:32; he
calls lust 'adultery' in 5:28."[^36] Similarly, Craig Blomberg interprets
Jesus' use of adultery as metaphorical, describing it as "faithlessness
to the person to whom one promised permanent loyalty."[^37] Therefore,
Blomberg and Keener's views demonstrate that one does not need to
embrace "invalid" divorce in order to interpret Jesus' charge of
adultery against those who divorce and remarry.

[^36]: Keener, "Remarriage for Circumstances beyond Adultery or Desertion," 106.


[^37]: Blomberg, "Marriage, Divorce, Remarriage, and Celibacy," 175.


Divorce is always the result of one or more persons' immorality. Without
sin and hardness of heart, divorce would never be considered. If the act
of divorce is not itself always immoral, then it at least follows acts
of immorality. However, labeling immoral divorce as "invalid" has
serious consequences for those who subsequently remarry, for they would
be in an adulterous "marriage". Such an adulterous lifestyle would be
rebellious and prohibit the remarried couple from inheriting the kingdom
of God (1 Cor. 6:9--11)!

Regardless of the validity of the divorce, most scholars claim that
remarriages subsequent to divorce are binding and ought to be honored.
For example, Instone-Brewer writes, "There is nothing to suggest that
Jesus asked anyone to separate from the second husband or wife if one
had remarried after an invalid divorce."[^38] This conclusion is even
affirmed by some with a permanence view of marriage.[^39] Despite such assent from disparate perspectives, logic dictates that if an invalid
(ineffective) divorce does not dissolve a marriage, then subsequent
remarriages would be either illegitimate or polygamous. However, the
biblical evidence demonstrates that serial marriages are neither
polygamous nor ineffective. Therefore, the use of "invalid" as a label
is unhelpful and unnecessary.

# Conclusion

Despite the ideal of indissolubility, marriage in a fallen world is
dissoluble by both death and divorce. While one may distinguish between
justified and unjustified divorce, all divorce is effective. Under the
authority of God and his Scripture, one may use the effectiveness of
divorce as a building block in a full systematization of marriage,
divorce, and remarriage. However, all would do well to remember God's
own attitude about the dissolution of marriage: "'I hate divorce,' says
the LORD God of Israel" (Mal. 2:16, NET). Likewise, may we all hate the
sin of divorce and the sin that leads toward it.
