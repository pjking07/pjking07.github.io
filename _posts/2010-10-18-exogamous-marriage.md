Rodney Stark's *The Rise of Christianity* is a sociological evaluation of early Christianity through the year AD 350. Stark sets out to examine the sociological elements behind the development of Christianity as a dominant cultural force. While Stark bases much of his book on widely accepted historical data, one section is particularly controversial, to say the least. In his chapter, "The Role of Women," Stark argues that exogamous marriage, i.e. marriage outside of a group, "was crucial to the rise of Christianity."[^1] In this essay, I will argue that Stark's conclusion regarding exogamous marriage is speculative in nature and historically untenable.

Summation of Stark's Claims
===========================

Stark argues that his case for the role of exogamous marriage in the spread of Christianity "can be made by resort to reason."[^2] The five reasons he asserts are:

1.  Peter and Paul both sanctioned exogamous marriage.[^3]
2.  There was an over-supply of marriageable Christian women.[^4]
3.  Early church writings demonstrate that exogamy was common for Christians.[^5]
4.  The early church did not expect to lose converts in exogamous marriages.[^6]
5.  Secondary conversion was frequent among the Roman upper classes.[^7]

Examination of Stark's Claims
=============================

An examination of each of the above arguments will shed light on their historical viability. While Stark's supporting sources will be considered fully, additional resources will be referenced in order to render a more thorough view of the historical data. As Carolyn Osiek states in her volume on women in the early church, "The disjunction between the bold claims of Stark and some ancient historians and the sobering cautions of other interpreters . . . calls for a reexamination of the evidence."[^8]

Claim 1: Peter and Paul Sanctioned Exogamous Marriage
-----------------------------------------------------

To introduce his section on exogamy, Stark boldly claims---in reference to 1 Corinthians 7:13--14 and 1 Peter 3:1--2---"Both Peter and Paul sanctioned marriage between Christians and pagans."[^9a] Although he grants that "both passages are commonly interpreted as directed toward persons whose conversion postdated their marriage," he argues "that these passages may reflect a far greater tolerance for exogamous marriage than has been recognized."[^9] However, many Patristic writers oppose this interpretation of Peter and Paul. Tertullian explicitly condemns those who interpret Paul as Stark does. Writing about those who read 1 Corinthians as "conveying permission to contract marriage with pagans," Tertullian prays, "God grant that those who interpret the text in this way are not practicing deliberate self-deception!"[^10] Speaking more generally, Augustine wrote of the "command of the Lord, teaching of the apostle, and commandment of the Old and New Testaments, whereby a believer is forbidden to enter a union with an unbeliever."[^11]

Stark quotes Wayne Meeks, who writes that, for Paul, "the divorce rule takes precedence over the preference for group endogamy."[^12] However, Meeks goes on to write, "It is clear that Paul's preference is that believers marry 'in the Lord,' that they marry other believers."[^13] Even Adolf von Harnack, whom Stark will later cite as an essential source, writes, "Paul was certainly assuming that the marriage was already consummated by the time that one of the partners became a Christian."[^14] In summary, no sources from early Christianity affirm Stark's position regarding exogamy---not even the sources Stark himself cites.


Claim 2: An Abundance of Marriageable Christian Women
------------------------------------------------------

Stark purports a consensus among historians "that there was a substantial oversupply of marriageable Christian women and that this was acknowledged to be a problem."[^15] He quotes Robin Fox, who states that the early church had a need "to match an excess of Christian women to a deficiency of Christian men."[^16] Fox further comments, "It is highly likely that women were a clear majority in the churches of the third century."[^17] Stark seems to consider the abundance of Christian women as his strongest argument for exogamous marriage as an evangelistic tool.

### Argument: Callistus allows concubinage

In an effort "to deal with the problem facing upper-class women whose only marital options *within* the Christian community were to men of far inferior rank,"[^18] Callistus ruled that Christian women could live in "just concubinage" with Christian men.[^19] Kenneth Latourette further explains that Callistus' ruling "was not polygamy and was tolerated because women outnumbered men among the Christians of the upper classes and a woman sacrificed her social status if she entered into formal marriage with a spouse of inferior condition."[^20]

Many historians seem sympathetic to Callistus' plight and subsequent ruling. Philip Reynolds presumes, "there were probably pressing pastoral motives behind the policy."[^21] Fox reasons, "Bishop Callistus was trying to allow prominent women to take Christian partners without suffering a legal penalty."[^22] However, Callistus' ruling was met by contemporary opposition, with some claiming that Callistus was giving license to adultery.[^23] Hippolytus was incensed by the idea "that a woman, though not legally married, might consider such a companion as a husband."[^24]

### Argument: How could Callistus condemn exogamy?

Harnack argues that Callistus was attempting to prevent upper-class women from "either marrying pagans or forming illicit connections with them."[^25] Within this context Stark makes an illogical jump, asking:

> If highborn Christian women found it so difficult to find grooms that the bishop of Rome permitted "just concubinage," how was he to condemn middle- and lower-class Christian women who wed pagans, especially if they did so within the church guidelines concerning the religious training of the children?[^26]

In her study of aristocratic women in the fourth century, Michele Salzman argues, "The problem of an adequate supply of senatorial men for senatorial women to wed went well beyond the Christian community and was endemic to the class as a whole."[^27] Thus, it is possible that the marriage problem Callistus faced with aristocratic women did not equally apply to Christian women of other classes. If so, this renders Stark's question moot.

Even if the problem was widespread, Callistus was not operating in isolation. Ignatius suggested that Christians "establish their union with the approval of the bishop that their marriage may be according to the Lord and not according to lust."[^28] According to Harnack, "Tertullian wrote the whole of the second book in his treatise *ad uxorem* [*To His Wife*] in order to warn his wife against marrying a pagan, if she became a widow."[^29]

As noted above, the Apostles' writings were understood to condemn exogamy. Beginning in the fourth century, formal restrictions were placed on Christian marriages, largely in an effort to prevent female exogamy.[^30] A preeminent example of this would be The Council of Elvira, which prominently issued a canon stating, "no matter the large number of girls, Christian maidens are by no means to be given in matrimony to pagans lest youth, bursting forth in bloom, end in the adultery of the soul."[^31]

Fox has a clear answer to Stark's question of how Callistus could condemn Christian women for marrying pagans: "it remained a firmly held view of the Church leadership that unmarried Christians should marry Christians only."[^32] Exogamy was prohibited on a theological basis---even by Callistus.

### Evidence: Adolf von Harnack

To conclude his argument on the abundance of marriageable Christian women in the early church, Stark cites Harnack as his definitive source, writing, "Summing up his long study of the sources, Harnack noted that many mixed marriages were reported and that in virtually all cases 'the husband was a pagan, while the wife was a Christian'."[^33] However, the cases to which Harnack is referring make no mention of whether the wives converted before or after their marriage. In fact, Harnack is merely demonstrating that "the number of prominent women who are described as either Christians themselves or favorably disposed to Christianity is extremely large."[^34] This section of Harnack's work has little---if anything---to do with exogamy.[^35] Indeed, the most Harnack writes about exogamous marriage is, "by the close of the second century, it was no longer an unheard-of thing for such mixed marriages to take place."[^36] Harnack's concession is hardly sufficient to establish exogamy as essential to the rise of Christianity.


Claim 3: Exogamy Was Common for Christians
------------------------------------------

Stark believes that the "frequency with which the early church fathers condemned marriage to pagans" indicates that Christians were commonly marrying pagans because "people tend not to keep harping on matters that are not significant."[^37] Stark interprets Tertullian's apparent anger about exogamy as a reflection of "the frequency of such marriages."[^38] However, Stark himself concedes, "The frequency with which early church fathers condemned marriage to pagans *could* demonstrate that Christians 'refused their sons and daughters in marriage to nonmembers'."[^39]

### Evidence: Michael Walsh

In supporting his argument, Stark leans heavily on Michael Walsh's treatment of Ignatius of Antioch, quoting Walsh at length: "Inevitably marriages between Christians and pagans were common, especially in the early years. The Church did not at first discourage this practice, which had its advantages: it might bring others into the fold."[^40] Walsh's claims, however, are unsubstantiated---his text includes no citations. It is impossible to follow up on his conclusions, and accordingly, this limits the credibility of Walsh as a basis for Stark's argument.

No one debates whether some Christians married pagans. Osiek writes, "There is no question that marriages between pagans and Christians existed in the church from Paul's day."[^41] However, no support for Stark's more radical view can be found. Recall Harnack's minimal view of the frequency of exogamy, noted above. Additionally, Salzman's study on fourth century marriages similarly leads her to conclude that "intermarriage between pagans and Christians was infrequent."[^42]

Finally, to suppose that vigor in teaching demands a high frequency of deviance is fallacious. As noted, exogamy was a theological issue. Perhaps the source of the strong condemnations was not frequency, but importance. Consider Tertullian's reaction to exogamy:

> When a certain woman recently married outside the Church, taking a pagan for her husband, and when I recalled that this same thing had been done by others before her, I was astonished that women could be so wanton---or their spiritual directors so recreant. There is no authorization in Scripture for conduct of this kind.[^43]


Claim 4: Early Church Expected No Loss in Exogamous Marriage
------------------------------------------------------------

Stark's next claim is that there was a "lack of concern in early Christian sources about losing members via marriage to pagans." He argues this point by considering pagan sources, modern sociological data, and early church sources.

### Evidence: Pagan sources and modern sociological data

Stark cites pagan sources describing the "obstinacy of Christian martyrs" and the "willingness of Christians to nurse the sick during the great plague" to demonstrate that "the high levels of commitment that the early church generated among its members should have made it safe for them to enter exogamous marriages."[^44] Stark also considers modern "high-tension religious movements" that successfully marry outside the group, such as Jehovah's Witnesses. He goes on to cite Greeley's Rule: "Whenever a mixed marriage occurs, the less religious person will usually join the religion of the more religious member."[^45] These accounts do allow for the speculation that a Christian could maintain her faith in an exogamous marriage, but they do not demand it, especially in the face of observations like Elizabeth Castelli's: "the intermarriage of Christian women with non-Christian men presented a clearly perceived, substantive risk that the women would convert when the men in question were Jewish."[^46]

### Evidence: Early church sources

The only early church sources Stark considers are Peter and Paul; he claims that neither "seemed to have the slightest worry that Christians would revert to, or convert to, paganism."[^47] According to Castelli, however, "Clement of Rome, Justin Martyr, Tertullian, and others, all expressed profound concern about the household discord and potential dangers produced by mixed marriages."[^48]

Tertullian clearly believed that exogamy would inherently inhibit the devotions of a Christian woman, writing, "Her duties to the Lord she certainly cannot fulfill according to the demands of ecclesiastical discipline, since she has by her side a servant of Satan who will act as an agent of his master in obstructing the performance of Christian duties and devotions." While Stark is correct that Peter and Paul did not actively address a Christian's reversion to paganism in a mixed-marriage, it is certainly clear that numerous other early church writers did.


Claim 5: Frequency of Secondary Conversion
------------------------------------------

Stark's final claim opens with a seemingly benign statement, "What we do know is that secondary conversion was quite frequent among the Roman upper classes."[^49] Stark cites Robin Fox and Henry Chadwick as evidence of this frequency; however, in a divergence from his typical format, he forgoes listing  specific citations.[^50]

### Evidence: Henry Chadwick

When Chadwick writes of the conversion of the upper-class in *The Early Church,* he states, "Christianity seems to have been especially successful among women. It was often through the wives that it penetrated the upper classes of society in the first instance."[^51] He says nothing about the success of secondary conversion in his work.

### Evidence: Robin Fox

Despite Stark's citing him, Fox actually claims that the secondary conversion of husbands was rare, writing, "Wives in an existing marriage might be converted and then an avenue opened for further conversion. . . . In higher society, she seldom succeeded, but there was hope for her subsequent children."[^52]

### Evidence: Adolf von Harnack

Stark cites Harnack's entire second volume in *The Expansion of Christianity in the First Three Centuries* as "evidence that many upper-class Christian women did marry pagans, some of whom they subsequently were able to convert."[^53] However, as established above, Harnack is non-committal on the frequency of exogamy.

### Evidence: Peter Brown

Stark concludes by citing that "Peter Brown wrote of women as a 'gateway' into pagan families where 'they were the wives, servants, and nurses of unbelievers'."[^54] It is innocuous to suppose, as Chadwick also affirms, that women were the first to convert in many pagan families. However, Brown does not consider exogamy explicitly when discussing his "gateway" metaphor. Notably, Brown's primary historical reference is the ambiguous Harnack.[^55] Castelli seems to be correct when she writes, "Virtually all claims that women were prominent or predominant in early Christianity can be traced back to Harnack's study."[^56]

Conclusion
==========

In an attempt to justify his thesis, Stark takes slim data and expands it to his liking. He consistently misrepresents the claims of his sources, even to the point of antithesis. Other authors have rightly questioned and rejected Stark's conclusions on exogamous marriage.[^57] Perhaps Rodney Stark himself said it best when he wrote, "In truth, there is no abundance of direct evidence that intermarriages between Christian women and pagan men were widespread."[^58] I have shown that the patristic fathers believed that apostolic teaching condemned exogamy, and that they themselves also condemned it. Most importantly, the historical evidence demonstrates that exogamy was infrequent and was rarely successful in producing secondary conversions. The evidence leaves no reason to believe that exogamy was crucial to the rise of Christianity, contrary to Rodney Stark's claims.
