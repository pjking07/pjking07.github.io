# Opener

As you turn in your Bibles to 1 Thessalonians 4, I want you to consider with me the pervasive nature of sexual immorality in our current culture. This is not an exercise in remembering the "good ol’ days" of yesteryear; rather, I want you to focus on the depths of sexual promiscuity, infidelity, unchastity, and perversion by which we are all surrounded, and of which many of us are partakers at one level or another. For example, many of us are familiar with the devastating effects of pre-marital relations and adultery. Furthermore, we see sexual immorality being promoted at all levels of society, whether it be redefining marriage, allowing polygamy, promoting pedophilia, questioning the prohibition of incest, or ignoring cases of bestiality. Indeed, our society rejects the Christian ethic of sexual chastity, that is, celibacy outside of marriage and fidelity within marriage, and prefers a therapeutic ethic of sexual activity in which all people are encouraged to pursue whatever sexual relationship makes them feel "good." Too often, Christians seem to reflect our culture’s sexual mores more than we reflect Christ’s sexual ethic.

The text we are going to consider today was written to Christians who were called to live holy lives within a society that embraced sexual immorality, just as ours does today. Undoubtedly, this text is as significant to us today as it was to its original audience nearly 2000 years ago.

# Text

Allow me to read 1 Thessalonians 4:1–8 from the ESV:

> Finally, then, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you are doing, that you do so more and more. For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you. For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness. Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you. (1 Thessalonians 4:1-8, ESV)

Dear Christian, if you leave today with only one thought, let it be this: "regarding all matters of holiness, but especially sexual morality, you ought to please God by growing in obedience to Jesus’ commands through the gift of the Holy Spirit."

Furthermore, I want you to be aware of three theological points that this text teaches about growing in holiness. (1) Growing in holiness is pleasing to God. (2) Growing in holiness is obeying Jesus’ commands more and more. And (3) Growing in holiness is empowered by the Holy Spirit. Although the majority of this text relates to (2) growing in obedience to Christ, I want you to understand how the Trinity works together to bring about our personal growth in holiness.

## 1. Growing in holiness is pleasing to God (vv. 1–2) 

Reading again verses 1–2, "Finally, then, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you are doing, that you do so more and more. For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus." Paul reminds the Thessalonians that they are to please God by continuing to walk in the manner they received from Paul himself, which he received from Jesus. God is pleased when his people grow in their obedience to his instructions.

We can see this in parenting. When my daughter was three years old, I was pleased when her obedience matched what I could expect from a three-year old. Now, as she grows up, I am often pleased in her own growth in obedience toward her mother and me. However, if, as a twelve year-old, she still obeys me only in the manner of a three-year old, then we would have a big problem—her failure to grow in obedience would bring her mother me great displeasure. In the same way, while we know moral perfection is not attainable here on earth, God expects his children to grow in obedience as we grow up in Christ. We are to live lives that reflect more and more what we already are in Christ Jesus: "We have been called, regenerated, forgiven, and adopted."[^1] Now we are to grow into our calling.

However, if you are outside of Christ, no good deed of yours will make you right before God. As God said through the prophet Hosea, "I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings" (Hosea 6:6). True obedience requires both external obedience and a heart of love. According to Jesus in Matthew 22:36–40, the greatest commandments are: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind," and "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." Obedience to God demands love for God and others. You must love God before you can obey him. Friends, love God and become the adopted children of the Father through the gospel message of the Son.

Remember, "Growing in holiness is pleasing to God."

Dear Christians, regarding all matters of holiness, but especially sexual morality, you ought to please God by growing in obedience to Jesus’ commands through the gift of the Holy Spirit.

## 2. Growing in holiness is obeying Jesus’ commands (vv. 2–7) 

### Know Jesus’ Commands

Before we can grow in obeying Jesus’ commands, we must know his commands. Let’s read once more from verse 2: "For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus." Out of his love for us, our self-revealing God has given us his word in the Scripture by which we can know him and his commands. Therefore, we can strengthen our growth in obeying Jesus by growing in our understanding of the Scripture.

Friends, we must read or listen to our Bibles often. I recommend reading large sections of Scripture in one sitting. We must also study our Bibles. We must struggle with the text, understand its meaning, and apply it to our lives—this is best done in the community of the church. Finally, we must know the Bible through Scripture memory. I highly recommend Andy Davis’ approach to extended Scripture memory and Tom Ascol’s *Truth and Grace* series of catechisms.

### Sanctification

Now, if we continue into verse 3, we read, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification." God’s will is that you be sanctified. Kevin DeYoung explains the two types of sanctification in his book *The Hole in Our Holiness*. [^2] (1) Positional sanctification begins at the moment of conversion when a Christian is counted holy, as Christ is holy. (2) Progressive sanctification is growth in the practical outworking of this positional holiness in the life of a believer. In verse 3, Paul is calling the Thessalonians to progress in their sanctification, so that they look more and more like the sanctified men and women that they are.

Friends who do not know Christ, God’s will for you is that you become positionally sanctified through faith in Christ.

Dear Christian, God’s will for you is that you live out your positional sanctification through the experience of progressive sanctification.

God’s will is for all to be sanctified through Jesus Christ. In the marathon of our holiness, some of us still need to *start* the race and the rest of us need to continue on to the finish line.

### Sexual Immorality

After encouraging the Thessalonians in their obedience to Christ, Paul is particularly concerned about the progress of their sanctification in the area of sexual morality. We see this in verses 3–5:

> For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God.

We can see that Paul calls Christians to control their bodies in holiness and not let themselves go to passionate lusts. Even more so, Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount that we must not only be holy with our bodies, but also with our eyes and mind, saying:

> "You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell." (Matthew 5:27–30)

Controlling one’s body in holiness and honor requires that one follows God’s standard of sexual chastity, namely, celibacy for the unmarried and fidelity for the married. This allows God’s gift of sexual intimacy to be spiritually, physically, and emotionally edifying with one’s spouse. However, if we follow the passions of our lust as those who do not know God, we pervert God’s blessing of sexuality into a curse.

Hence, we must not allow our sexual morality to be based on the mores of our surrounding culture. In Thessalonica, it was considered normal sexual behavior for a man to take on a wife, a mistress, and concubines. We can see the sexual immorality of the world entering the church through cases of serial divorce and remarriage, a growing ambivalence about homosexuality, and the pervasive consumption of sexually explicit material through all types of media, including pornography

Dear Christian, do not act like the heathen who do not know God. Do not allow them to define what is right and wrong. Submit to the teaching of God—safeguard your heart, body, and soul. Flee from sexual immorality.

Finally, verse 6 provides one last instruction followed by a serious warning, "that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you." Friends, when you sin sexually, you sin against many people. First, you sin against God, whose law you transgress when you are sexually immoral. Second, you sin against others, whether he or she is the object of your lust, your illegitimate partner, or your spurned spouse. Third, you sin against yourself, for Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 6:18, "the sexually immoral person sins against his own body."

Against such sin, Paul warns, "The Lord is an avenger in all these things." The writer to the Hebrews similarly wrote in Hebrews 13:4, "Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous." Friends, the day of vengeance will come soon. Turn to Jesus and find forgiveness of all your sins, including sexual immorality.

Continuing in verse 7, we read, "For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness." Dear Christian, God has called you to be holy. Flee from immorality. Flee from impurity. Flee from the wrath to come for those who do not love God and do not follow his commands. And beware, as verse 8 reads, "Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God." Paul has reminded us to please God by obeying Jesus’ commands and living holy lives. Are you going to disregard this message? If you do, you are disregarding God himself. Therefore, heed the message of Paul and follow the commands of Jesus.

Remember, growing in holiness is obeying Jesus’ commands.

Dear Christians, regarding all matters of holiness, but especially sexual morality, you ought to please God by growing in obedience to Jesus’ commands through the gift of the Holy Spirit.

## 3. Growing in holiness is empowered by the Holy Spirit 

Our final point comes from the last phrase of verse 8, "God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you." Now, we see another Person in the Trinity at work in this passage. Dear Christian, God has given to you his Holy Spirit so that you might grow in your sanctification. The Holy Spirit empowers us so that we can do the hard work of obeying Christ. Indeed, the Spirit of God is called the Holy Spirit for a reason: he dwells in Christians in order to make us holy and help us live holy lives. It is impossible for any of us to follow the commands of Christ without the gift of the Spirit.

Imagine God’s role in your sanctification like this: you are walking around outside in a dark, moonless night. You know that you are looking for the path to God’s pleasure, but you don’t know how to get there. As you stumble about, you meet Jesus, who knows how to get you to this right path. At first, you are unable to follow his commands because you can’t see in the dark. However, by placing your faith in Jesus, you receive the Holy Spirit, who acts as a flashlight. By the new light before you, you are able to see that the path to God’s pleasure is in front of you and you are able to follow the commands of Jesus along the path. Thus, by the Holy Spirit, you finally have the ability to choose to follow the commands of Jesus and find your way down the path of God’s will and good pleasure.

Friends who do not yet know Christ, you are totally incapable of being holy until you have the presence of the Holy Spirit. Thank God that the indwelling Holy Spirit is a gift for all who believe. Friends, place your trust in Christ, become a slave to him, declare him to be Lord, and repent of your sins—then you will receive the gift of the Spirit of God to live in you.

Remember, growing in holiness is empowered by the Holy Spirit.

Dear Christian, regarding all matters of holiness, but especially sexual morality, you ought to please God by growing in obedience to Jesus’ commands through the gift of the Holy Spirit.

# Conclusion

God’s will is for you to be sanctified. For our friends who do not yet know Christ, God earnestly desires that you become holy, as Christ is holy, by placing your faith in the person of Jesus. This Jesus, fully God and fully man, lived the life we should have lived and died the death we should have died so that he could conquer both sin and death for people like you and me. If you follow Jesus and declare him to be Lord, you can join in his right standing before God the Father and thus be righteous, holy, and sanctified. Once you know Christ in this way—and for all of us who are already Christians—God’s will is that we grow in sanctification by obeying the commands of Christ, more and more. We who trust Christ have received the Holy Spirit and are no longer dead! Therefore, we ought to stop acting like dead people. Rather, we who are alive together with Christ ought to live as those who are alive! Let us join together in doing the commands of God, encouraging one another in the Lord.

Dear Christians, regarding all matters of holiness, but especially sexual morality, you ought to please God by growing in obedience to Jesus’ commands through the gift of the Holy Spirit.
