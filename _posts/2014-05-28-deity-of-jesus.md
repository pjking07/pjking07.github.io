If Jesus was not God, then we have no salvation in him. Our salvation is given in right standing before God; only God can give such right standing. Jesus, who is the Son of God incarnate, is the Person of God with whom we participate in right standing before God. If Jesus was not God, or did not remain God, then we would not be united with God.

For this reason, the Son remains God in his descent into humanity. The Son never stops being God. Jesus must be God in order to effect our salvation, to overcome sin and death. Otherwise, Jesus is merely a man who lived a good life and was martyred for his teaching. Jesus as a man alone turns Christianity into a pietistic ethic. However, when the Son descends, he remains God.

If the work of Jesus remained intact, but Jesus was not in fact God, then the only person affected by the life of Jesus is Jesus himself. Jesus sits at the right hand of God, but if he is not himself God, then we cannot participate in the life of God. Without the union of God and man in Jesus, no other human can participate in the life of God. Even if Jesus' perfect life and sacrifice were sufficient for the forgiveness of our sins, his human sacrifice would be insufficient for bringing restoration to humanity. We may find forgiveness through the sacrifice of the man Jesus, but we would not find eternal life.

In descending to the earth, the Son of God remained God and became man in order to make men into sons of God by adoption. The Son is our one Lord  who became human and remains as a God-man. Because of Jesus' united humanity and divinity, men can be united with God in the same way. We can become partakers of the divine nature through the righteousness of the God-man. The Son never abandons his divinity nor his humanity. If either is abandoned, then we can find no salvation in him.

If you lay aside the divinity of Jesus, then you are left with a human being who cannot save anyone by his own power. You have a human being who has not been united with God. Rather, you have a human being who is lifted up as a model of perfection---a perfection in which no imperfect person can then share. The human-only Jesus becomes an unattainable ideal for life. His sacrifice on the cross may forgive sins but it would not cover sins. Though Jesus was resurrected, we would not share in his resurrection---and surely not in his resurrection glory. We may be forgiven of sins, but we would not have the life of God; therefore, we would remain in the ground. Once our physical life dies, we would not receive spiritual life and the reuniting of body and spirit.

The deity and humanity of Jesus is essential to our understanding of salvation. Without both natures united in one Person, humanity will die and have no hope of future resurrection. Without both natures united in Jesus, we cannot be united with God. Without both natures united in Jesus, we cannot receive the life of God. Without both natures united in Jesus, we cannot be made right before God. Without both natures united in Jesus, we will return to the dust of the earth and remain there. Without both natures united in Jesus, we have no hope of salvation, no friend found in God, no restoration with God, no Brother with whom we are adopted. Without both natures united in Jesus, we are utterly lost.

Praise God for the mystery of the gospel: The Son of God became man in order to unite God with mankind so that men can be saved!
