Justification is to die to sin. To be just is to be righteous. The righteousness given in justification is right standing before God. Therefore, justification is to be made right with God. One is justified by grace through faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Rather than by works of the law, one is justified through faith by the righteousness of Christ. The believer is able to share in Jesus' right standing by participating in his death and resurrection through faith. Justification is the giving of light and life to an individual. Faith is the means by which one has life; through faith, this one is justified and made righteous. 

The very righteousness of God replaces the unrighteousness of the person---through faith. Justification is the righteousness of God supplanting the unrighteousness of a man. The only way to regain the life of God is through faith. In salvation, God justifies a man by God's own righteousness. Through justification, God shows himself to be just and gracious. Through Christ, God extends the opportunity for justification to all people---Jew and Gentile alike. Justification is not attained through observance of the law; justification is only attained through faith in Christ. Even Abraham was called righteous before the law was given and before he was circumcised.

Justification makes one right before God. Being justified is not the same as having good works. Works do not make one right before God, only justification by grace through faith. While one's actions ought to reflect one's right state before God, good actions do not make one right before God. In the same way, wrong actions do not make one bad before God. Individuals are righteous or unrighteous regardless of particular actions. Justification bestows righteousness which is a right relationship with God. Salvation is not a progression toward actual righteousness; in our conversion, God gives to us his very righteousness. One's righteousness is not improved, it is replaced. Outside of Christ, our righteousness is as filthy rags. Righteous deeds to not make one righteous before God; only through sharing in Christ's righteousness can any be received by the Father.
