Augustine's *Confessions* is an auto-biographical account from the Bishop of Hippo. Written in the late 4<sup>th</sup> century, this work is a form of prose and poetry addressed to God, but penned for the benefit of Christians everywhere. *Confessions* is parsed into thirteen books; book VIII, *The Birthpangs of Conversion*, describes a number of years in Augustine's life and---as the title suggests---depicts the author's painful yet joyous conversion experience.


Conversion Catalysts
====================

In the midst of describing his own life and struggles, Augustine shared the conversion of two other Christians, whose stories he had heard. In both cases, the stories were used as a catalyst toward his own conversion. In those men's lives, God overcame struggles which seemed different than Augustine's primary struggle at the time---women. However, Augustine applied both of the stories back to his own life and his own struggle.


Conversion of Victorinus
------------------------

The first conversion described in *Birthpangs* was that of Victorinus, who served as a tutor to the nobles. Before his conversion, Victorinus was an ardent defender of the pagan cults. He was so well respected by the elites that he was even given a statue in the Roman forum. As public was his defense of paganism, so was his conversion to Christ. Eventually, Victorinus was forbidden by the Empire to teach any longer, and he was forced to abandon his school.

After hearing this story, Augustine realized his need to follow Victorinus' example, that he must give up pursuit of the rewards of this world. Although Victorinus had given up the pleasures of this world through his loss of vocation, wealth, and status, Augustine had a different pursuit which needed defeating. Augustine himself states, "My secular activity I held in disgust, and now that I was not burning with my old ambitions in hope of honor and money . . . I was still firmly tied by woman" (VIII.2).


A Story within a Story
----------------------

Ponticianus, an acquaintance of Augustine's, told Augustine a story about the conversion of his unnamed friends. While walking about, these friends came upon the home of one of Ambrose's monks. Within the home, the friends read the *Life of Antony*, an account of an Egyptian monk. While Augustine does not offer any details of the story of Antony, he does describe the conversion the friends experienced as they were reading the book.

At the time of the friends' conversion, they decided to give up their earthly pursuits, for they were agents in the special branch and had aspired to be Friends of the Emperor. From Augustine's account, it even seems that the friends stayed at the monastery from that point forward, having "fixed their hearts on heaven," despite the fact that they both had wives. Later, their wives themselves "dedicated their virginity" to God (VIII.15).

Perhaps it was the aspect of the wives which Augustine most identified with in this account of the friends. Augustine explained that, through this story, God "delivered [him] from the chain of sexual desire" (VIII.12). In fact, while Augustine was hearing this story from Ponticianus, he began to feel the birthpangs of his own conversion.


Augustine's Conversion
======================

The remainder of Augustine's account in *The Birthpangs of Conversion* lay solely within his own personal conversion experience. At first, he saw the awfulness of the sin that was within him; he described himself as "twisted and filthy, covered in sore and ulcers" (VIII.16). In his great struggle, Augustine removed himself from his house and went to the garden outside.

While in the garden, Augustine had a battle of his wills---not of two wills, but many. However, all of the wills were still he himself. He "was neither wholly willing nor wholly unwilling" (VIII.22). Augustine accused himself severely and "was twisting and turning in [his] chain until it would break completely" (VIII.25). He struggled as he came nearer and nearer to a decision, but stayed just short of it.

Augustine's bad habits personified and asked, "Are you getting rid of us?" One of his wills was asking himself, "Do you think you can live without them?" (VIII.26). In response, Augustine had a vision of the chaste Lady Continence and her children. She asked, "Are you incapable of doing what these men and women have done? Their Lord God gave me to them. . . . Cast yourself upon him, do not be afraid" (VIII.27). Augustine came to realize that "this debate in my heart was a struggle of myself against myself" (VIII.27).

After further removing himself into the garden, Augustine wept and cried out, "How long, O Lord? How long, Lord will you be angry to the uttermost? . . . Why not an end to my impure life in this very hour?" (VIII.28). The Lord responded to him "pick up and read, pick up and read" (VIII.29). Remembering a similar occurrence in the *Life of Antony*, Augustine hurried inside and picked up the book of the apostle. Opening up the book, Augustine read from Romans 13:13--14, "Not in riots and drunken parties, not in eroticism and indecencies, not in strife and rivalry, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh in its lusts" (VIII.29).

Through this experience, Augustine was converted to his Lord Jesus Christ. He immediately told all the Christians who were nearby, including his mother. He no longer had any earthly desires. Augustine closes *Birthpangs of Conversion* with this, "The effect of your converting me to yourself was that I did not now seek a wife and had no ambition for success in this world" (VIII.30). Surely, the labor pains of Augustine's new birth had gone, and the joy of his new life in Christ had arrived.
