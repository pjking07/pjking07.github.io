# Introduction

Disparate views on church polity abound across the catholic church. Books addressing the different governmental structures establish up to nine forms of general polity.[^i-a1] A Baptist press even provided a platform to debate three types of Baptist polity, among others.[^i-a2] Despite the prevalence of divergent opinions, one may discover a biblical church polity expressed in the Scripture. This paper will argue that congregational governance under multiple-elder leadership was the paradigmatic polity of the New Testament local church and ought to be the standard for local churches today.

# Elder Leadership

In past centuries, many Baptist churches installed multiple elders; however, the practice fell out of favor during the eighteenth century. Thankfully, today, "there is a growing trend to go back to this biblical office."[^el-1a] As will be established below, the New Testament paradigm of church leadership is that of multiple elders in a local church.

## One Office

The New Testament uses the terms overseer, pastor, and elder interchangeably to describe one office.[^el-oo-a1] Benjamin Merkle provides multiple arguments in support of the synonymity of elder and overseer.[^el-oo-a2] First, Paul sent for the elders of the church of Ephesus (Acts 20:17).[^esv] After the elders came to him, he addressed them as overseers, instructing them to care for the church of God (Acts 20:28).[^el-oo-a3] In his epistle to Titus, Paul instructs his protégé to appoint elders in every town; then, he immediately lists the qualifications for such an overseer (Titus 1:5--7).[^el-oo-a4] Finally, Peter provides the most comprehensive link between elder, overseer, and pastor, exhorting "the elders" to "shepherd (pastor) the flock", "exercising oversight" (1 Pet. 5:1--2).[^el-oo-a5] Therefore, the New Testament authors use forms of the terms for elder, overseer, and pastor interchangeably; thereby, these terms are synonymous.[^el-oo-a6]

Akin, "The Single-Elder Church: The Bible's Witness to a Congregational/Single-Elder-Led Polity," in Brand and Norman, 40; Paige Patterson, "Single-Elder Congregationalism," in *Who Runs the Church: 4 Views on Church Government*, ed. Steven B. Cowan, Counterpoints: Church Life (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2004), 134; John S.

Second, Merkle argues, "Elders are never given separate qualifications."[^el-oo-b1] Although the epistles of 1 Timothy and Titus both mention elders and overseers, Paul only lists qualifications for "overseers" (1 Tim. 3:1; Titus 1:7). Merkle argues that because elder is clearly an office (cf. 1 Tim. 4:14), one "would expect the qualifications to be clearly stated for such an important position."[^el-oo-b2] That is, because the terms elder and overseer are both used for offices in the church and the qualifications lists of the Pastoral Epistles are limited to the offices of overseer and deacon, one may conclude that overseer and elder describe the same office.

[^el-oo-b1]: Merkle, *40 Questions about Elders and Deacons*, 80.
 
[^el-oo-b2]: Ibid.

Third, Merkle contends that elders and overseers are synonymous because they both have the same function within the church.[^el-oo-c1] A qualified overseer must manage his household well (to demonstrate that he can manage the church well) and must be qualified to teach (1 Tim. 3:2, 4). Similarly, Paul calls the church to honor the elders who manage well the church and labor in teaching (1 Tim. 5:17).[^el-oo-c2] Therefore, the offices of elder and overseer (as well as pastor) are one synonymous office. Notably, "Baptist confessions of faith utilize all three terms for this church office."[^el-oo-c3]

## Multiple Elders in the New Testament

Unfortunately, Baptist churches have fallen away from the historical practice of installing multiple elders in a local church.[^el-me-a1] However, the biblical evidence should encourage all Baptists to restore the installation of multiple elders in local churches.[^el-me-a2] Summarily, "We know of no church in the New Testament that had only a single elder."[^el-me-a3] In contrast, multiple passages in the New Testament show local churches having a plurality of elders (Acts 11:30, 13:1, 14:23, 20:17; Titus 1:5; James 5:14; 1 Pet. 5:1--2; Phil. 1:1; Heb. 13:7, 17, 24; 1 Tim. 4:14, 5:17).[^el-me-a4] These will be noted in brief.

[^el-me-a1]: Dever, *Nine Marks of a Healthy Church*, 229.

[^el-me-a2]: Cf. Hammett, 177.

[^el-me-a3]: Samuel E. Waldron, "Plural-Elder Congregationalism," in Cowan, 212. 

[^el-me-a4]: Ibid.

The church in Antioch sent relief  to the elders of the church in Jerusalem (Acts 11:30). Related, Luke lists multiple prophets and teachers leading the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1). In Lystra, Paul and his companions appointed elders for the new church (Acts 14:23). In the same manner, Paul instructed Timothy and Titus about elders in the local churches of Ephesus and Crete (1 Tim. 5:17; Titus 1:5). Peter exhorts "the elders among you" to shepherd the flock and exercise oversight (1 Pet. 5:1--2). The writer to the Hebrews instructed the church to "remember your leaders", "obey your leaders and submit to them", and "great all your leaders and all the saints" (Heb. 13:7, 17, 24). Finally, Paul and Timothy wrote an epistle addressed, "To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons" (Phil. 1:1). 

While all these passages clearly demonstrate multiple elders over a geographic locale, some passages explicitly demonstrate plural leadership in a single local church. In Acts 20:17, Paul "sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him." Similarly, James instructs those who are sick to "call for the elders of the church" (James 5:14). The New Testament paradigm of church leadership is clearly multiple elders over a single church within a geographic locale. Therein, Merkle rightly concludes, "The New Testament evidence indicates that every church had a plurality of elders."[^el-me-b1]

[^el-me-b1]: Merkle, *40 Questions about Elders and Deacons*, 164.

The firmly established New Testament paradigm of plural eldership provides many practical benefits to a local church. Alexander Strauch lists  three: balancing people's weaknesses, lightening the workload, and providing accountability.[^el-me-c1] Merkle adds that multiple elders better represents the nature of ministry and the church.[^el-me-c2] While not providing evidence for biblical eldership, these brief benefits display the wisdom behind God's design for plural eldership.

[^el-me-c1]: Alexander Strauch, *Biblical Eldership*, Rev. ed. (Littleton, CO: Lewis & Roth, 1995), 39--44. 

[^el-me-c2]: Merkle, *40 Questions about Elders and Deacons*.

Despite the biblical basis and practical benefit of plural eldership, some still argue in favor of a "single elder" model of leadership within Baptist churches.[^el-me-d1] For instance, Paige Patterson argues in favor of one "decided leader of the congregation" based on the psychology of leadership, the historical pattern of the president of the synagogue, and the "biblical pattern" of singular leadership found in Moses.[^el-me-d2] In light of the textual evidence, one may reject Patterson's noted psychological and synagogal patterns; however, his notion of a biblical pattern of singular leadership demands a response. Even if Moses has established a pattern of singular leadership, Christ is now the singular leader of the Church. Jesus is the head of the Church and the Greater Moses (Heb. 3:1--6; Eph. 5:23). 

[^el-me-d1]: Patterson, 150.

[^el-me-d2]: Ibid., 150--151

[^el-me-d3]: Ibid., 151--152

Patterson's final argument centers on the addressing of the letters of Revelation to "the angel of the church"---an inferred reference to the single pastor of a congregation.[^el-me-e1] If this is the best biblical evidence by which single elder leadership "becomes clear,"[^el-me-e2] then Patterson's argument is weak indeed. Instead, Baptists ought to embrace the biblical evidence for a plurality of elders within a single local church.

# Congregational Governance 

The New Testament describes a church whose members make up one body under the headship of Christ (Rom. 12:5). All rule and authority belongs to Christ, which he expresses through the Scripture.[^c-a1] Therefore, "Congregationalism is *government* by the congregation" and "allows for *leadership* by pastors, elders, and/or deacons, even strong leadership and a measure of delegated authority."[^c-a2] As will be argued below, the paradigm for the New Testament church is congregational governance with elder leadership under the headship of Christ.

[^c-a1]: Cf. Hammett, 143.

[^c-a2]: Ibid., 146. Emphasis original.

## Priesthood of all Believers

The Christian faith was "once for all delivered to the saints" (Jude 3). These saints make up "a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession" (1 Pet. 2:9). This royal priesthood of the saints belongs to the corporate body, not to mere individuals or leaders.[^cr-pb-a1] Indeed, the priesthood of all believers is perhaps the most foundational building block of congregationalism.[^cr-pb-a3]  Eddie Long notes a connection between affirmations of the priesthood of all believers and affirmations of congregational polity. He notes the same connection between a denial of the priesthood of all believers and an affirmation of "clerical priesthood or pastoral authoritarianism."[^cr-pb-a2] 

[^cr-pb-a1]: Akin, 37.

[^cr-pb-a3]: Ibid., 35.

[^cr-pb-a2]: Long, 185.

Given the priesthood of all the saints, one role of the collective priesthood is the governance of the local church under the rule and headship of Christ. While different member-priests may have defined roles within the body, i.e., elders and deacons, each member belongs to the priesthood. Therefore, the royal priesthood ought to governance the local church through congregationalism.[^cr-pb-b1] Specifically, the priesthood of all believers supports the democratic principle within congregationalism, that is, members ought to govern the church through democratic voting.[^cr-pb-b2] As priests, congregants serve one another and must have others' best in mind; therefore, "the burden of responsibility does not fall only on the leaders of the church but on the church as a whole".[^cr-pb-b3] Because "every believer is a priest, the necessity of an official priesthood is negated."[^cr-pb-b4] Christ rules the church and, under Christ, the collective priesthood governs the local church.

## Congregationalism in the New Testament

The New Testament provides much evidence in favor of congregational polity in a local church. James Garrett establishes congregationalism as the paradigmatic polity for the early church through six directly applicable texts (Matt. 18:15--20; Acts 6:3, 13:2--3; 15:22; 1 Cor. 5:2; 2 Cor. 2:6).[^cr-ec-a1] Each will be addressed in brief.

First, Jesus ends his simple instruction on escalating church discipline, teaching, "If he refuses to listen to them [two or three witnesses], tell it to the church. And if refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector" (Matt. 18:17). In matters of church discipline (and therefore, church membership), Jesus explicitly grants authority to "the church---that is, the assembly of those individual believers who are the church."[^cr-ec-a2]

[^cr-ec-a1]: James Leo Garrett, Jr., "The Congregation-Led Church: Congregational Polity," in Brand and Norman, 158--159.

[^cr-ec-a2]: Dever, *Nine Marks of a Healthy Church*, 221.

Second, in order to address the need of equitable service toward both Jewish and Gentile widows, the apostles instructed all the disciples (the entire church of Jerusalem) to "pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty" (Acts 6:3). The apostles gave to the entire congregation the task of selecting lead servants for the church; thus, "they were recognizing in the church assembly . . . ultimate authority, under God."[^cr-ec-b2] 

[^cr-ec-b1]: Garrett, 162.

[^cr-ec-b2]: Dever, *Nine Marks of a Healthy Church*, 222. 

Third, when the church at Antioch was "worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.' Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off" (Acts 13:2). In the same way that the apostles had called on the church to select servants, the Holy Spirit himself called on the church to commission its first missionaries.[^cr-ec-c3] 

[^cr-ec-c3]: Cf. Garrett, 164; Patterson, 145.

Fourth, after the whole church listened to the report of Barnabas and Paul, "it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church [in Jerusalem], to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas" (Acts 15:22). The entire church body chose and commissioned men to go to Antioch. Furthermore, these men delivered a letter to the gathered congregation of the church in Antioch (Acts 15:30). While this relationship between the church in Jerusalem and the church in Antioch supports the doctrine of local-church autonomy, the individual congregations appear to govern their respective churches.[^cr-ec-d1]

[^cr-ec-d1]: Patterson, 146; Hammett, 146.

Fifth, Paul reiterates Jesus' call for the congregation to govern over church discipline. He writes to the church in Corinth, "When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus, you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord" (1 Cor. 5:4--5). The congregation was to excommunicate this "incestuous church member".[^cr-ec-e1] "Paul addressed not the elders, but the congregation as a whole,"[^cr-ec-e2] once again demonstrating that the authority over church discipline lies with the congregation. 

[^cr-ec-e1]: Garrett, 168. 

[^cr-ec-e2]: Akin, 31.

Sixth, Paul writes to the Corinthians, "this punishment by the majority is enough" (2 Cor. 2:6). Again, Paul addresses the congregation's authority over church discipline: the majority of the congregation inflicted this punishment of church discipline. Furthermore, this majority likely refers to a democratic principle of voting in the church.[^cr-ec-f1] "Since the individual involved had repented, Paul now urges them [the church] to restore him. Again, the responsibility is placed on the congregation."[^cr-ec-f2]

[^cr-ec-f1]: Patterson, 145.

[^cr-ec-f2]: Hammett, 148.

Notably, many of the above passages showing congregational governance in the New Testament church relate to church discipline. Samuel Waldron writes, "No greater exercise of church power is conceivable. If the local church is competent for church discipline, then it is competent to all lesser exercises of authority."[^cr-ec-g1] These New Testament passages show a clear paradigm for congregational governance in a local church. Elders lead the church, but the church governs itself under the headship of Christ.

[^cr-ec-g1]: Waldron, 208.

# Leading the Governors

God calls the elders of a local church to shepherd the flock, equip the saints, exercise oversight, and serve the church (1 Pet. 5:1--2; Eph. 4:11--12; Acts 20:28). While elders are to lead a church into godliness, both they and the church serve under the ultimate authority of God and his will (Acts 15:1--35). As Matthew McDill wrote in his dissertation on the authority of elders, "Human leadership in the church, then, does not include ruling and legislation but a body of believers following Christ together with the benefit of the leadership of godly, gifted members."[^el-l-a1]

[^el-l-a1]: Matthew D. McDill, "The Authority of Church Elders in the New Testament" (PhD diss., Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, 2009), 196.

Elders lead the church with authority but not as authoritarians.[^el-l-b1] Similarly, the church submits to the leadership of its elders voluntarily, ensuring those elders lead as under-shepherds of Christ.[^el-l-b2] Mutual submission between members and to the elders defines the governance of the congregationalism (Eph. 5:21; Heb. 13:17). Those who govern the church are to submit to the biblical leadership of the elders. Rather than undermining the leadership of the elders, the congregation ought to have a "right balance of authority and trust" placed in its leadership.[^el-l-b3] This frees the elders to "lead, direct, govern, manage, and care for the flock of God" in their care.[^el-l-b4] 

[^el-l-b1]: Cf. Benjamin L. Merkle, *Why Elders? A Biblical and Practical Guide for Church Members* (Grand Rapids: Kregel, 2009), 38.

[^el-l-b2]: Cf. Ibid., 39.

[^el-l-b3]: Dever, *Nine Marks of a Healthy Church*, 227.

[^el-l-b4]: Strauch, 25.

Despite any natural inclination to establish hierarchies in government, the New Testament demonstrates that the members of the body govern the church through equality. Every regenerate member has equal footing and authority within the body of Christ. However, God has established offices and leaders in the church in order "to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ" (Eph. 4:12). God has called the congregation to the work of ministry, including the ruling of the church, under the guidance of spiritually gifted leaders, the leading of the Holy Spirit, and the headship of Christ.

# Conclusion

Congregational governance under multiple-elder leadership was the paradigmatic polity of the New Testament local church and ought to be the standard for local churches today. This governmental structure allows the body to operate under the headship of Christ while allowing each member to serve and lead in accordance with his or her gifts of the Spirit. Even as the congregation serves as the earthly authority over the church, members  must simultaneously submit themselves to the God-given leadership of the church, with discernment. May churches everywhere submit themselves to the headship of Christ and the New Testament paradigm for local church polity.
