# Summary

Fred Lybrand implores his readers to utilize a form of extemporaneous preaching that he has named "preaching on your feet." Lybrand’s methodology promotes constructing a sermon at the moment of delivery, rather than delivering a sermon from a manuscript or notes. Preaching on your feet is similar to the historic practice of preaching extempore in which a "practiced thinker" delivers, without aid, the culmination of his own research and reflection. This approach is not merely a "no notes" methodology because the preacher does not memorize his notes or a manuscript. Rather, the preacher does not develop his articulation of the sermon until the preaching event. Lybrand avers that churches need preaching filled with "life, relevance, and connection" and that preaching on your feet is the necessary model for delivering such sermons (loc. 126).

The author contends, "Preaching is actually about winning the listener to think, feel, and act in accordance with the biblical truth at hand" (loc. 291–292). Accordingly, preaching that effectively wins the listener must include persuasion, earnestness, and personality. All three are necessary because persuasion requires earnestness and earnestness requires personality. These three essentials to preaching, Lybrand writes, are best achieved through the medium of "preaching on your feet" by connecting with the audience through the delivery of a uniquely crafted message.

Lybrand notes many advantages for both the preacher and the audience through his "preaching on your feet" methodology. Foremost is the time advantage—sermon composition takes place at the time of delivery, thereby eliminating the time-consuming task of constructing a sermon manuscript. Furthermore, the preacher enhances his connection with the audience through sustained eye contact; this connection also allows the preacher to adapt to the audience’s response to his sermon. Finally, the preacher skilled in extemporaneous preaching is ready to deliver a sermon at a moment’s notice because "if you don’t know how to preach on your feet, then you cannot be ready until the manuscript is ready" (loc. 491–492).

Lybrand offers two "master keys" for effectively preaching on your feet: the preacher must learn the method and he must practice it exclusively. The author offers three necessary elements for preparing to preach on your feet: the use of one’s own style of preparation (solo style), soaking one’s soul in the topic at hand (saturation), and communicating clearly one primary idea (single focus). In the case of preaching on your feet, Lybrand emphasizes, "Delivery cannot be taught, but it can be learned" (loc. 1052). He concludes that extemporaneous delivery is tied closely to one’s preparation and personality; such preaching ought to come naturally, out of an overflow of passion, personality, and practice.

The final chapters of *Preaching on Your Feet* address issues exclusive to extemporaneous preaching (rather than extemporaneous speaking), namely, following the Spirit, and expositing the text. While the author affirms that the Spirit leads the preacher through both delivery and preparation (including manuscripting), he avers that an extemporaneous preacher is more open to the guiding of the Spirit in the moment of delivery because he is not bound to a manuscript. However, the author notes that an extemporaneous preacher ought to be bound to Scripture, use the text as an outline, and deliver an expositional sermon. Indeed, Lybrand is so convinced of his method that he ultimately concludes, "Preaching on your feet can better change the world" (loc. 1441–1442).

# Notable

## Connect with the Audience

Lybrand writes that the preaching event should unite the heart of God with the hearts of the congregants through the heart of the preacher. Furthermore, Lybrand argues that extemporaneous preaching is the best method for connecting these hearts through communication. Preaching on your feet allows the preacher to connect with the audience through eye contact, adjust his delivery and content based on the apparent comprehension of the congregation, and follow the leading of the Spirit in the moment of delivery. While the preacher who is delivering a sermon via a manuscript or notes can be diligent to practice the above, a preacher skilled at delivering extempore has an advantage in these areas.

## Saturate and Squeeze

In both preparation and delivery, Lybrand exhorts preachers to pour out themselves into their sermons. In an apt analogy, the author instructs the preacher to soak himself in the passage at hand and then, as a thoroughly soaked sponge, squeeze out himself during the sermon. Consequently, "A manuscript or notes become unnecessary when a preacher is truly saturated, that is, when a preacher truly understands his subject and the passage at hand" (loc. 934–935). The preacher can only deliver a quality extemporaneous sermon by immersing himself in the study of the passage, issues, references, and applications of the text. By fully grasping one’s understanding of the text, the preacher is able to deliver a message with persuasion and earnestness through his own personality. As Lybrand writes, "The fire and the heartbeat in a sermon are formed in the preparation, not in the moment" (loc. 898).

## Time Management

Lybrand repeatedly emphasizes the benefit of extemporaneous preaching to time management. By not constructing the final draft of a sermon until the moment of delivery, the preacher is able to save time that he would have spent composing a manuscript. Even if a preacher does not fully subscribe to "preaching on your feet," a similar time advantage applies to preaching with limited notes. Although those who write manuscripts may be able to craft a more accurate and compelling argument, those who lack adequate time can save much time by preaching extempore. The preacher can then spend what preparation time he does have on study and reflection rather than the explicit wording of the sermon. Therefore, the extemporaneous preacher would be more often available for other pastoral duties.

# Quotable

## On Readiness

> If you don’t know how to preach on your feet, then you cannot be ready until the manuscript is ready. (loc. 491–492)

Lybrand spends little time on this excellent insight: those who rely solely upon a manuscript cannot preach at a moment’s notice. This fact alone ought to be enough to convince any pastor of the necessity of developing the skill of preaching extempore. Whether or not one prefers extemporaneous preaching, this skill is necessary in order to fulfill unexpected, immediate pastoral demands. 

According to Lybrand, being able to preach extempore enhances the pastor’s ability to have meaningful conversations with parishioners. Furthermore, the pastor’s need to be able to preach or speak at a moment’s notice ought to encourage the pastor in deeper Bible study and memorization. One must be able to recall quickly the text and meaning of the Bible, not merely the opinion of a commentary (although commentaries are valuable). In situations that require immediate words, the pastor who knows how to communicate well in the moment will minister in a more meaningful manner.

## On Plagiarism

> Between the time I finish a sermon on a Thursday or Friday and the delivery of the sermon on Sunday, I continue to grow in the Lord; therefore, if I preached on Sunday something I concluded on a Friday, it’s plagiarism because it was written by another person (that is, who I was on Friday)! You may think this is a play on logic, but it’s actually a play on truth. We are the person we are in the moment we preach; and when we copy, even ourselves, it has the cavernous sound of an echo. (loc. 96–99)

Lybrand’s comment on self-plagiarism is one of many off-putting remarks in *Preaching on Your Feet*. Promoting the idea of one’s identity changing over time has serious philosophical implications, e.g., the impossibility of personal responsibility over time, the ineffectiveness of individual salvation, and the mutable identity of God the Son. Furthermore, Lybrand’s actual point—that preaching from a manuscript is an echo from the past—is unsupported. While the preacher’s material must be fresh in his mind for an effective delivery, a sermon delivered by manuscript can be effective regardless of its date of composition.

## On Preachers with Manuscripts

> The most effective preachers are those who preach on their feet, and the least effective ones are those who preach on their seats. (loc. 65–66)

> . . . 
> 
> If we continue to write, use thick notes, take the seminary classroom into the pulpit, and, even worse, subscribe to other preachers’ sermons and read them as though they are our own, we’re not only *doing damage to our current congregations*, but we’re setting the stage for the fine art of authentic preaching to disappear from the ranks of those leaders in the generation ahead. (loc. 407–409, emphasis added)

Throughout this book, Lybrand shows his dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of non-extemporaneous preaching. Indeed, he calls such preachers "ineffective" and laments that they are "doing damage to [their] congregations." Unfortunately, his disparagement toward other sermon delivery methodologies permeates his entire work. Thankfully, his demonstrated opinion appears to moderate as the book progresses. For example, toward the end of the book, Lybrand writes, "Some exceptional preachers are able to prepare a thick outline or a manuscript and bring it to life for an audience" (loc. 1419–1420). However, Lybrand counts the ability to preach a manuscript not as a skill in preaching, but in acting, which he presents as far less valuable.

Especially disquieting is Lybrand’s association of manuscript-based delivery with plagiarized preaching. Such a comparison ignores the preparation given by the manuscripting preacher in understanding the text, researching the context, and developing his own sermon. Furthermore, many notable and persuasive preachers bring manuscripts or copious notes into their pulpits. Lybrand unfairly attacks such men when he contends they are damaging their congregations through their chosen delivery method.

## On Charles Finney

> Charles G. Finney is indeed one of the most famous preachers in American history. You may not particularly like his theology, but the fact that he reached hundreds of thousands of people in his preaching career is almost without parallel in history (loc. 281–282).

Finally, Lybrand weakens his book through his heavy reliance upon (and affirmation of) Charles Finney as a model for extemporaneous preaching. Far from being what some "may not particularly like," many have accused Finney of anti-evangelical and heretical in his theology.[^1] While Charles Finney was surely an effective communicator who elicited emotive responses from his hearers, he left a legacy too tainted for anyone to use as a model for evangelical preaching. Despite this, Lybrand quoted or noted Charles Finney 36 times without further qualification, showing the author’s positive view of the late revivalist.

# Conclusion

In *Preaching on Your Feet*, Fred R. Lybrand argues that all preachers should practice exclusively extemporaneous preaching. He notes the many benefits to both preacher and congregant from extemporaneous preaching. However, his imperious tone throughout and brash disposition against naysayers yields an unhelpful contribution to the field of sermon delivery. Furthermore, Lybrand made such use of long citations from the likes of James Buckley, Charles Spurgeon, and Charles Finney, that one may prefer to read their works directly. Finally, by offering scant advice on how one can develop into an excellent extemporaneous preacher, Lybrand confirms his own assertion that preaching on your feet cannot be taught.
