In his chapter, "Puritan Evangelism", J. I. Packer distinguishes between what he calls "modern" evangelism and Puritan evangelism. Essentially, Packer views modern evangelism as the descendent of Finneyism, rooted in "occasional activity, additional and auxiliary to the regular functioning of the local congregation" (p. 292). To contrast, Packer views Puritan evangelism as that which is consistent with the conviction "that the conversion of a sinner is a gracious sovereign work of divine power" (p. 294), divine grace, and divine freedom.

Regarding the sovereignty of God in evangelism and salvation, Packer wrote, "It is never man, but always God, who determines when an elect sinner shall believe" (p. 298). Initially, I was affronted by the lack of mentioning man's own will (transformed by God) regarding the initiation of belief. However, upon further consideration, Packer's emphasis on determination rightly belongs to God for his will always supersedes the will of man; each man's will works under the sovereign will of God.  Because God transforms a man's will with the gift of belief, the man's will is inherently secondary to the will of God in determining one's manner, means, and timing of conversion. Therefore, Packer's seeming overstatement is technically accurate as God's sovereignty determines all that is and all that happens, including salvation.

Whereas Packer sees backsliding as a natural consequence to modern evangelism's emphasis on revivalistic 'decisions', he views Puritan evangelism as one having truer, albeit fewer, converted disciples. Regarding this emphasis, Packer writes, "while stressing the urgency of seeking Christ and becoming a true and thorough Christian, they funnel enquirers into catechetical classes, nurture groups, and church worship" (p. 301). While today's evangelical churches may utilize the latter two activities, the idea of adult catechetical classes struck me. I wondered if and how that type of adult ministry would work in our churches today. 

Later, Packer ended up asking the same question later (p. 307) and answered that such efforts in modern churches will only succeed with pastoral oversight and congregational participation. How many doctrinal problems in modern evangelical churches could be remedied through catechizing our converts and disciples of all ages? As I have personally seen the benefit of catechisms in the training of my children, I am aware of the effectiveness of such an endeavor at the congregational level only in more liturgical contexts. Perhaps our evangelical churches today ought to seriously consider providing catechetical teaching as part of our modern discipleship efforts.
