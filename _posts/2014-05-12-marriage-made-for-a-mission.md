# Introduction

American culture today seems to be at odds with the institution of marriage.  Through abnegation, dissolution, and attempts at redefinition, many are opposed to the traditional definition of marriage.[^i-1] Even some who self-identify as Christians find themselves opposing the boundaries of marriage as understood by the Church for millennia.[^i-2] Given the current cultural commotion, the Church would do well to consider carefully the purpose and definition of marriage. The Christian Scripture lays down the foundation of marriage in the creation narrative of Genesis 1--2.[^i-3] This narrative shows that the purpose of marriage is to promote mankind's mission to "be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it" (Gen. 1:28).[^i-4] As a result, the definition of marriage is universal and immutable.

# The Mission for Marriage in Creation

The beginning of Genesis introduces God and his relationship with creation, especially mankind. Within the creation narrative are two descriptions of God's creation of mankind, one in summarized form within the context of God's six creative days (Gen. 1:26--30) and the other as an expanded, personal narrative (Gen. 2). The former account shows mankind to be a special creation, made in the image of God as male and female. God commissions these two representative humans to "be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it" (Gen. 1:28). In order to understand marriage as defined in Genesis 2:24, one must keep in view the purpose of marriage, namely, the mission of mankind.

## Man Needs a Woman

In the Genesis 2 narrative, God creates the man out of the dust and places him in the garden with the command "to work it and keep it" or "to worship and obey" (Gen. 2:15).[^mmc-mnw-1] However, God then declares, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him" (Gen. 2:18). The man's solitude was "not good" because he lacked the helpmate necessary to participate in the mission of mankind to fill the earth. Therefore, God lead the man in a search for his mate among "every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens," but he found no suitable helper (Gen. 2:19--20). There was no other creature with which the man could be fruitful and multiply.[^manneeds-1] Therefore, God took from the man a rib and formed it into a woman---his wife (Gen. 2:21--22). Upon seeing his new mate, the man sang a song and rejoiced over the one who "is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh" (Gen. 2:23). God gave the man a helpmate of his own kind so that they together could fulfill the God-given mission of mankind.[^manneeds-2] 

[^mmc-mnw-1]: John H. Sailhamer, "Genesis," in *The Expositor's Bible Commentary*, Rev. ed., vol. 5 (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2008), 79. Sailhamer argues that "to work it and keep it" ought to be translated as "to worship and to obey."

## Marriage Defined

God's gift of a bride to Adam made the first marriage, which is the basis for all marriages. Immediately following the presentation of the woman to her husband, Moses writes, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh" (Gen. 2:24). This verse is the foundation of the biblical definition of marriage.[^mmc-md-1]

[^mmc-md-1]: Cf. Mathews and Hubbard, 177; Andrew Cornes, *Divorce and Remarriage: Biblical Principles & Pastoral Practice* (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 1993), 52.

From Genesis 2:24, Köstenberger and Jones define marriage as "a sacred bond between a man and a woman, instituted by and publicly entered into before God (whether or not this is acknowledged by the married couple), normally consummated by sexual intercourse."[^mmc-md-2] Köstenberger and Jones rightly acknowledge the universal scope of the marriage definition found in the creation narrative. As Andrew Cornes writes, "God joins together every couple in every valid marriage. He has been doing so, according to Christ, since 'the beginning of creation.'"[^mmc-md-3] As a tool designed for the mission of mankind, the Genesis 2 definition of marriage applies to all of mankind.

## The Mission is Cursed

Subsequent to the first human sin, God cursed the serpent, the woman, and the man in unique ways. God cursed the man and the woman by making difficult certain aspects of their assigned mission. God cursed the woman by multiplying her pain in childbirth and giving her desires against her ruling husband, thus inhibiting their mission to multiply and fill the earth (Gen. 3:16). Similarly, God cursed the man by making the work of the ground require much toil in order to produce its fruit, thus inhibiting their mission to subdue the earth (Gen. 3:17--19). God cursed the serpent by putting enmity between the woman and her offspring. However, the serpent's curse included the promise to mankind of a progeny who will crush the serpent's head (Gen. 3:15).[^miscurse-1] Notably, this promised offspring could only come about through mankind's participation in its God-given mission to fill the earth. Therefore, although cursed and difficult, the mission of mankind remained: "be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it" (Gen. 1:28). 

[^miscurse-1]: Cf. Köstenberger and Jones, 27.

After the fall, the mission of mankind remained unchanged; therefore, marriage also remained unchanged.[^miscurse-2] Even prior to the Noahic flood, the wicked were "marrying and being given in marriage" (Luke 17:27). After the flood, God recommissioned Noah with the mission of mankind: "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth" (Gen. 9:1). Therefore, both the mission of mankind and the corresponding definition of marriage remain as they always have, though fallen and difficult.

[^miscurse-2]: Cf. Mathews and Hubbard, 23.

# Alternative Purposes for Marriage

Christians have proposed other purposes for marriage that are not rooted in the mission of mankind. While some of these purposes maintain the definition of marriage as established in creation, they do not establish a basis for the immutability of marriage. Though there are many alternative perspectives to the purpose of marriage, three views will be discussed in brief. 

## Marriage for Holiness

Gary Thomas wrote a helpful book, *Sacred Marriage*, which attempts to answer the question, "What if God designed marriage to make us holy more than to make us happy?" Thomas writes that the purpose of marriage can be growing individuals in "service, obedience, character, pursuit, and love of God."[^apm-mh-1] The author is right that Christian marriages ought to promote growth in such capacities; however, he seems to mistake the purpose for universal marriage with the benefits of Christian marriage. Just as celibate Christians are to use their celibacy to grow in service and obedience, married Christians are to use their marriage to grow in holiness. Growth in holiness is the expectation for all believers, regardless of marital status; therefore, the purpose of marriage cannot be growth in holiness. Marriage, which is a robust institution with many benefits, was made for promoting the mission of mankind.

[^apm-mh-1]: Gary Thomas, *Sacred Marriage* (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2000), 26.

## Marriage for Friendship

Timothy and Kathy Keller penned another practical book on Christian marriage entitled *The Meaning of Marriage*. The Kellers write that the purpose of marriage "starts with the principle that marriage is a friendship."[^apm-mf-1] Genesis 2:18 establishes that it was not good for man to be alone; thereby, the Kellers argue that what made man's aloneness "not good" was his loneliness. They contend that Adam's vertical relationship with God did not fulfill his "intense relational capacity" because "God designed us to need 'horizontal' relationships with other human beings."[^apm-mf-2] Such "loneliness in paradise" seems unlikely given that sin had not yet separated man from God; surely, the man was not lonely in the presence of Triune Godhead. Rather than being a relational problem, the man's aloneness was "not good" because he needed a mate in order to fulfill his mission. The result that his mate might also be his friend is a benefit of marriage, not its purpose.

[^apm-mf-2]: Ibid., 111.

## Marriage for Multiple Purposes

Rolf Veenstra writes of a three-fold purpose for marriage: "[1] the propagation of the human race, [2] the furtherance of the kingdom of God, and [3] the enrichment of the lives of those entering this state."[^apm-mmp-1] While Veenstra's first purpose aligns with the mission of mankind, the second purpose aligns only with Christian marriage. If the purpose of marriage includes the furtherance of the kingdom of God, then those who are not Christian ought not to be married. However, marriage is universally available to all men of any faith; therefore, its design and purpose must also be universal. Christian marriages ought to further the kingdom, but marriage is an optional tool for such work. However, marriage is required for the universal mission of mankind. Finally, Veenstra's third purpose of enrichment is yet another example of a benefit resulting from proper marriage. While marriage ought to enrich lives, lives can be enriched without marriage and marriage does not necessarily enrich lives. However, the mission of mankind can only be properly fulfilled through marriage.

# Implications for Marriage Today

Because the universal mission of mankind continues to this day, the purpose and corresponding definition of marriage has not changed. Marriage continues to exist in order to promote mankind's mission and will exist as it is until the latter days.[^mismar-1] Although marriage is not required of every man or woman, marriage was made for the mission of mankind; the purpose and definition of marriage must not be separated from its mission. However, those who take up the tool of marriage ought to do it for the purpose of the mission; such couples ought to leave and cleave in order to fill the earth.

[^mismar-1]: I.e., marriage will fundamentally change or cease to exist in the new heavens and new earth. cf. Ernest White, *Marriage and the Bible* (Nashville: Broadman, 1965), 35; Matt. 22:30; Mark 12:25.

## Marriage and the Great Commission

A greater mission than the mission of mankind is the one found in Jesus' Great Commission (Matt. 28:18-20). The universal mission is a command for mankind to fill the earth with physical progeny; the Great Commission is a command for Christians to fill the earth with spiritual progeny. Whereas marriage is required for the fulfillment of the universal mission, marriage is not a necessary tool for the Great Commission. Both the sexually celibate and those who marry may participate equally and fully in the Great Commission.[^mmt-mgc-1] 

[^mmt-mgc-1]: Cf. White, 139--140; Keller, 195; William F. Luck, *Divorce and Remarriage: Recovering the Biblical View* (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1987), 3; 1 Cor. 7:32--35.

Christians ought to intend for their marriage to be a tool for both the universal mission and the Great Commission. Therefore, those joining in Christian marriages should intend and desire both physical and spiritual progeny from their union,[^mmt-mgc-2] although circumstances may inhibit or prohibit such reproduction. As Mathews and Hubbard assert, "When Christians sign on for marriage, they sign on for marriage as mission."[^marmis-3] Christians who do not desire to participate in the mission of mankind ought not to join together in matrimony.

[^marmis-3]: Mathews and Hubbard, 243.

[^mmt-mgc-2]: Veenstra, 89; cf. Douglas Anderson, "Marriage as Sacred Mystery: Some Theological Reflections on the Purposes of Marriage," *Word & World* 5, no. 4 (September 1, 1985): 366.

## Immutable Definition of Marriage

God created gender, sexuality, and marriage for all mankind in order to promote the universal mission.[^manneedsB-1] Gender and sexuality were given for multiplication;[^manneedsB-2] marriage was given as the proper context for such sexuality and reproduction.[^manneedsB-3] Removing any of these gifts (gender, sexuality, or marriage) from the context of the mission of mankind will pervert their created nature and intended purpose.[^manneedsB-4]

[^manneedsB-1]: Cf. Mathews and Hubbard, 188.

[^manneedsB-2]: Cf. Mathews and Hubbard, 178; White, 9; Luck, 2.

[^manneedsB-3]: Cf. Köstenberger and Jones, 41; Cornes, 65.

[^manneedsB-4]: Cf. Köstenberger and Jones, 80.

Thus, Christians ought not to consider as marriage any joining of individuals who do not make up "one man and one woman". For example, polygamy is an aberration of marriage, causing strife and leading men astray.[^mardef-0a] Similarly, just as Scripture prohibits homosexual practice,[^mardef-4a] any attempt at legitimizing such a union is a rejection of the purpose and definition of marriage.[^mardef-4] Furthermore, fornication and adultery are both abnegations of the design for the one-flesh union to be within marriage alone (1 Cor. 6:16).[^mardef-6] Even divorce, which both testaments regulate, deviates from the creation narrative and is always a result of sin.[^mardef-3] 

[^mardef-0a]: Cf. Köstenberger and Jones, 33; contra Luck, 243.

[^mardef-4a]: E.g., Gen. 19:1--29; Lev. 18:22, 20:13; Judg. 19:1--21:25; Rom. 1:18--32; 1 Cor. 6:9; 1 Tim. 1:10; Jude 7.

[^mardef-4]: Cf. Köstenberger and Jones, 36; White, 54--56.

[^mardef-6]: Cf. Köstenberger and Jones, 35; White, 48--52.

[^mardef-3]: Deut. 22:19, 29, 24:1--4; Matt. 19:1--12; Mark 10:1--12; Luke 16:18; cf. Köstenberger and Jones, 34.

The purpose of marriage is to promote the universal mission of mankind; therefore, the universal definition of marriage is immutable. Thus, the standard definition for marriage must be established in Genesis 2:24: a man leaving his family, holding fast to his wife, and becoming one flesh with her.[^mardef-0] Even if society succeeds in redefining the colloquial  and legal usage of the term "marriage", Christians should not recognize any aberration of marriage as marriage in the sight of God.[^marabb-1] 

[^mardef-0]: Cf. Köstenberger and Jones, 32; White, 34.

[^marabb-1]: Cf. Cornes, 79. 

# Conclusion

The purpose of marriage is to promote mankind's mission to "be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it" (Gen. 1:28). As a result, the definition of marriage is universal and immutable. Although marriage is optional for individuals, it is the only proper context for human sexuality. Furthermore, marriage for all people ought to promote the universal mission of mankind and Christian marriage ought also to promote the Great Commission. As culture continues to protest the Christian conception of marriage, may Christians everywhere hold firm to their convictions, substantiated by the text of Scripture and the creation narrative. However, rather than waging a culture war, Christians ought to show love to their neighbors while proclaiming the Good News of Jesus Christ. The gospel of grace must be ever on the lips of those serving as ambassadors for the God who is reconciling the world to himself through Jesus Christ.
