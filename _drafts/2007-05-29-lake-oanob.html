<p>Last Friday was “Africa Day” – a holiday celebrated across... well, Africa.
</p><p>
For that holiday, friends of Sybille gave her a stipend to go to Lake Oanob. Sybille didn’t want to go by herself, so she invited my missionary family to come along. Chad couldn’t go because he was playing in an indoor hockey (field hockey) tournament.
</p><p>
Lake Oanob is a man-made lake in the town of Rehoboth, 45 minutes south of Windhoek.</p><p>
This place was gorgeous – I have never been by such a still lake before. The water was much too cold to actually get in, and we didn’t do any water sports. We stayed in a villa right on the lake. We were there for 2 nights and we mostly sat around, talked, read, ate, and played with slingshots. There were a lot of ducks around our house… sadly, no one would let me shoot the ducks. We did get to go hiking at the game reserve for a few hours – I got pretty close to some giraffe and zebra. The view from our porch was beautiful; we really enjoyed just looking out at the lake.

This was my last bit of holiday before the youth ministry really started going. Pray that I’ll be able to work hard and consistently – as well as get enough rest – because we should be going pretty hard from here on out. Just to give you an idea, we host our first team (From Highland Baptist in Waco) in just two weeks…</p>    <p class="sig">-PJ</p></div>
