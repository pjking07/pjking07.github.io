    <p>
        Teen authors <a href="http://www.therebelution.com/dohardthings/authors.htm">Alex and
            Brett Harris</a> recently released their first book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Do-Hard-Things-Rebellion-Expectations/dp/1601421125/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222650139&sr=8-1">
                Do Hard Things</a></em>, with the tag-line, "A teenage rebellion against
        low expectations." The Harris twins are nineteen and are currently freshmen in <a
            href="http://www.therebelution.com/blog/2008/08/why-we-are-going-to-college/">college</a>.
        They have administered the website and blog "<a href="http://therebelution.com/">The
            Rebelution</a>" since 2005.

        This book is engaging from the start. The opening paragraph reads:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Most people don't expect you to understand what we're going to tell you in this
            book. And even if you understand, they don't expect you to care. And even if you
            care, they don't expect you to do anything about it. And even if you do something
            about it, they don't expect it to last.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, we do.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The authors begin their book by reviewing the history of adolescence and emphasizing
        the newness of our cultural concept of the "teenager". The book touches on the history
        of some people who did big (hard) things during their teen years, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">
            George Washington</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Barton">Clara
                Barton</a>. The authors then call for the reader to redefine their view
        of adolescence and see it not as a time of idleness before adulthood, but rather
        as a launching pad for adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>
        This book was written as an encouragement for teenagers to <em>do hard things</em>.
        The Harris brothers message is directed towards teenagers, but readers of all ages
        would benefit from the authors' exhortations. The authors list five things that
        they particularly have in mind when mention <em>hard things</em>:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Things that are outside your comfort zone</li>
        <li>Things that go beyond what is expected or required</li>
        <li>Things that are too big to accomplish alone</li>
        <li>Things that don't earn an immediate payoff</li>
        <li>Things that challenge the cultural norm</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Throughout the book, the authors exemplify this list with many stories of the hard
        things done by youth today. The examples they include are definitely encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
        The chapter that was most convicting for me was "Raising the Bar". This portion
        of the book encourages youth to battle complacency. According to the authors, it
        takes little effort for some youth to be considered "above average". They may be
        naturally inclined to do better than most (youth) in academics, sports, or music.
        An external cause of complacency, say the authors, is that youth are not held to
        a high enough standard. Those who naturally perform above this low standard have
        little reason to take on a challenge. An internal cause of complacency is that the
        teenagers who easily excel in some areas refuse to challenge themselves in other
        fields which are more difficult for them. This refusal can stem from a fear of failure
        (or of mediocrity). The authors' encouragement is for youth to do those things in
        which they excel, but also to challenge themselves by doing hard things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another important concept is found in the chapter "Small Hard Things". Most of the
        book is about doing <em>big</em> hard things. This chapter encourages the reader
        to also do <em>small</em> hard things which are hard because:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>They don't usually go away after you do them [such as cleaning]</li>
        <li>They don't seem very important</li>
        <li>They don't seem to make any difference</li>
        <li>They don't seem very glamorous</li>
        <li>No one is watching</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This chapter provides great encouragement for the reader to do the small things
        well. As Luke 16:10 (NIV) reads, “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also
        be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest
        with much.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Although this book is a great encouragement for youth of all ages to do hard things,
        sometimes the reading feels like a standard self-help book. I counted six different
        action plans throughout the book. This specific critique is not for everyone; I
        am simply not a big fan of generic action plans.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Do Hard Things</em> is a courageous and encouraging book from Alex and Brett
        Harris; I know these men will be influential for years to come. I strongly recommend
        this book to all ages; it will not only encourage younger (and older) readers to
        do harder things, but it will also encourage older readers to raise their expectations
        of youth.
