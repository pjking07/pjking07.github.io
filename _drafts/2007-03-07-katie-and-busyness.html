<p>A lot has happened since I was able to post last. 
</p><p>
I dropped my Biology class - and I get to graduate! I am now down to 8 hours (two lab courses). This is so much better than being in that Math class I was originally in... </p><p>
On Thursday and Friday, I spent a lot of time preparing for my ELEN exam and working on a Critical Design Review for my <a href="http://courses.cs.tamu.edu/rgutier/cpsc483_s07/">senior design</a> class. 
</p><p>
Friday, Katie came in and we took the rest of the weekend off from school. In exchange... we ran errands (YES!). We looked at things from luggage to socks. Friday night, I had to sign 250 Namibia letters that Katie brought down from my Mom. We watched Kindergarten Cop (although Katie fell asleep...) while I signed letters for an hour. Saturday we did a lot of the errands, went to Abuelo's (thanks to a gift card from one of Katie's roommate's parents... which Katie got for her birthday in OCTOBER), and watched Lady in the Water. 
</p><p>
Also, this weekend Katie cooked for me. And it was great. It was so much better than the Voila that my roommates and I have started making all the time. Of course, she cooked me fajitas! And another chicken meal thing... and PANCAKES Whoop! 
</p><p>
On Saturday we went to the pond by my HP office. It was fun and relaxing to just sit there and take <a href="http://tamu.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2267580&amp;l=af156&amp;id=8304780">pictures</a> for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>When Katie left Sunday, I had to get back to doing school work. I finished studying for the exam I took Monday... I think it went all right. I also spent a considerable amount of time getting my team's CDR prepared. We presented the design on Tuesday - that also went well. 
</p><p>
I also went to a scholarship dinner last night. It was at the ritzy <a href="http://www.miramont.cc/">Miramont Country Club</a> - but the food didn't taste <em>that</em> good and the portions were pansy-sized small. Nathan and I both left hungry. And why do the nice places seem to always have fruity dessert?? Just give me some chocolate cake or cheesecake! However, I was grateful for the free meal.</p>  <p>That's a quick catch-up on my week.</p></div>
