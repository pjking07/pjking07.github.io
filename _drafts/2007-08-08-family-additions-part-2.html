<p>If you recall an earlier post of mine (located <a href="/2007/06/family-additions.html">here</a>) you know that my missionary family got a new puppy in June. Well, last Thursday, we dropped off the Woodway team at the airport. Before the team left the ground, Bryan and I picked up another new puppy.
</p><p>
This puppy is a border collie named Griffin. Griffin’s name is a different spelling of Gryphon which is a brand for field hockey that also makes shoes [read my <a href="/2007/06/family-additions.html">previous family additions post</a> if you want to understand what I’m talking about with the shoes…]
</p><p>
Griffin was purchased mainly to replace Reebok, who might die soon from old age. The life of Nike, an older border collie, would be extended with Griffin there to play.

<p>We had a party with our dogs and Francis’ new one. From left to right, we have Francis holding his dog, Rambo. Chad holding his dog, Reebok. Francis’ nephew holding Fila. I’m holding Griffin. Riko is holding Nike.

This makes four dogs and one cat that my missionary family owns.
