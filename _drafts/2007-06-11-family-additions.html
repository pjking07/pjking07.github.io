<p>Last Sunday we added another person to our family. Amber (Dana’s niece) will be staying with the family until early August, leaving a few days before I leave. She is from Colorado and just graduated from high school. So far, Amber has been mostly tolerating my annoying behavior...
</p><p>We also added another member to the family – Fila. Current and past pets of my family have been named Adidas, Reebok, Jordan and Nike. Fila is a 2-month old Yorkshire Terrier that Dana got for her birthday. The dog is very small right now and is extremely cute.
