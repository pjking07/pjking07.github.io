<p>According to <a href="http://www.evangelicaloutpost.com/" title="original link is broken">the evangelical outpost</a>,

<blockquote>Lila Rose, a pro-life student and reporter at UCLA, launched an undercover investigation aimed at exposing the racial insensitivity of Planned Parenthood. With the help of an actor, she contacted Planned Parenthood clinics in seven states, inquiring if they would be willing to accept a donation earmarked for the abortion of black babies. Not one employee objected or questioned the request, even when the actor insisted that the purpose was to "lower the number of black people" in America.</blockquote>

I also found this video of John Piper speaking on the racial profiling done by Planned Parenthood abortion providers.</p>

<p>I highly recommend both of these videos - they run 6 - 8 minutes each.
