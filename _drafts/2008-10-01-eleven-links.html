    <p><em>Jesus is My Friend!</em>
    </p><p>
The following video is of a song by "Sonseed". Can you guess which year this was recorded? I can't. It was probably before I was born.</p>
<iframe class="video full" title="Jesus is My Friend" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1iUU6jTqB6k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>
  My favorite lines from the song:
  <blockquote>
   He taught me how to pray<br/>
   And how to save my soul<br/>
   He taught me how to praise my God<br/>
   And still play rock and roll.<br/>
   <br/>
   He taught me how to live<br/>
   My life as it should be<br/>
   He taught me how to turn my cheek<br/>
   when people laugh at me.<br/>
   <br/>
   Once I tried to run,<br/>
   I tried to run and hide.<br/>
   Jesus came and found me<br/>
   And he touched me down inside.<br/>
   He is like a mountie,<br/>
   He always gets his man.<br/>
   And he'll zap you any way he can. Zap!

<p>
  It's true. Click the link to read the letter. The following is the closing of the letter:
  <blockquote>
   The breast is best! Won't you give cows and their babies a break and our health a boost by switching from cow's milk to breast milk in Ben and Jerry's ice cream? Thank you for your consideration.

  Sam McGuffie was a senior in 2008 in Houston. He liked to hurdle other players. This video is one of those plays.</p>

<p>  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/29/miron.bailout/index.html#"><em>Bankruptcy</em>, not bailout, is the right answer</a>

  This commentary from Jeffrey Miron sits well with me. I am not a fan of the bailout package. What are your thoughts?

  This is useful information for those who have either occasional or chronic insomnia.
</p><p>
  From the article:
  <blockquote>
<p>Q: How do I know if I need a sleeping pill?
</p><p>
A: More than a third of Americans experience occasional insomnia, which is defined as a few nights of restlessness, poor sleep, or trouble falling asleep. The general rule of thumb: If insomnia lasts a month and doesn't get better, talk to your doctor... [continued in the article]</p>

Sept 24 was National Punctuation Day! Did you celebrate? I bet you observed it unofficially by using punctuation in your writing. If only people would use proper punctuation in emails...
</p><p>
 And - for those of you who don't realize the importance of punctuation, you can read <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060806.wr-rogers07/BNStory/Business/home">this article</a> detailing how a comma cost a company $2.13 million.
