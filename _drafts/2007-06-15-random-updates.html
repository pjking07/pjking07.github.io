<p>Ronny's team arrived Tuesday and went to Etosha Wednesday through Friday afternoon. It is now Friday night.
</p><p>
Etosha is a huge game reserve in northern Namibia... it's where Bryan takes teams so they can experience the Bush (not George).
</p><p>
I hear they had fun. Amber and Bryan went - Dana, Chad, and I stayed home. I should be going with Bob's team from FBC Woodway in July.
</p><p>
Tonight we had YWAP and Ronny's team did half of it. YWAP took about 2 hours tonight - which is really long, but it was good.
</p><p>
Bryan talked some, they played a video I made (an interview video), Namib kids did a skit, the Namib band played, the Highland BC band played, Ronny showed a Nooma video, Ronny talked... so, it went long.
</p><p>
While they were in Etosha, I spent my three days staring at computers - trying to figure out the file format issues I'm having with my camcorder.
</p><p>
You see: with a DV camcorder, you do your video editing with AVI files - which are video files with very little compression - ideal for editing. My hard drive camcorder records directly to a dolby digital MPEG-2. This is a compressed video file - ideal for storing, non-ideal for editing.
</p><p>
Since MPEG-2 is not ideal for editing, many/most video editors don't support MPEG2 input files. CyberLink PowerDirector does... which is good.
</p><p>
The MPEG-2 recordings are also <a href="http://www.videomaker.com/article/9634/">interlaced instead of progressive</a>, so if you play the videos in a normal player like, Windows Media Player, they look bad (they have skewed horizontal lines). I finally figured out that if I play these files in a DVD player program on the computer, the DVD player will de-interlace the video. It took me a long time to discover this because my recorded files are initially ".MOD". PowerDVD (whichever version I have) doesn't understand ".MOD". Even if I tell PowerDVD to open the file, it doesn't know what to do. I found out today that if you change the file extension from ".MOD" to ".mpg" PowerDVD <em>does</em> read the file, and will play it correctly.
</p><p>
I'm currently using a trial version of PowerDirector and hope to use the trial all summer (1-month trial, but I have multiple computers I can work on.) When I get back to the states, I'll do some better research and find which editor will be best for my situation (like Ulead, Vegas, or Premiere Elements).
</p><p>
Other than researching which editor to use, I think I am finally done being frustrated with the file type issues on my camcorder (I hope.)
</p><p>
How did it get to be 1:00AM? I have to be gone at 8:30 tomorrow morning.
