<p><em>[Update: I was sent on a mission downtown - by myself. I was successful in making it back without hitting anything or stalling. Whoop!]</em></p>

<p>Bryan wants me to learn how to drive before our first team comes in two weeks. There are two problems with me driving in Namibia: 
</p>
<ol><li>
nearly all cars use standard transmission
</li><li>
for some reason, everyone drives on the left side of the road
</li></ol>
<p>
Now, I’ve never driven a stick-shift consistently. Thankfully, I had a roomamte who had a standard and I was able to learn much from driving BJ’s truck. However, I was never able to shift out of novice.
</p><p>
me + stick-shift + foreign location + foreign driving styles + driving on the wrong side of the road = disaster
</p><p>
Maybe I’m exaggerating, but I have now been out driving with Bryan three times. After the first two trips, I thought I was doing pretty well – I wasn’t stalling, I was driving on the right… er, “correct” side of the road. Then, on my third trip, Bryan had me drive downtown. Apparently with all the newness and the traffic, I got a little nervous. I think I stalled the car about 8 times. <em>Ouch.</em>

Thankfully, I was only in traffic for one of those stalls. Three were me trying to drive up the hill of his driveway from a stopped position. But we’re alive and I haven’t hit anything yet.
