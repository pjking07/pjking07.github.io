<p>I don’t have the intention of posting everyday I’m here. I plan to post (1) when I have time, (2) when something interesting happens, and (3) at least once a week. That being said, today was a bit interesting.
</p><p>
Today, I woke up at 04:30. That’s right – 4:30 in the morning (MY morning, not yours).
</p><p>
Now, if you look at a map of Namibia, you will notice that Windhoek is in the middle of the nation. Today, we drove 3.5 hours to the coast, to a city called Swakopmund. We drove in for a funeral service honoring the mother of dear friends of my hosts. It was a Catholic funeral, but I had no idea what was going on due to the microphone system’s lack of clarity. 
</p><p>
After the funeral, the grieving family hosted a tea (a white Namibian tradition) at a nearby hotel. Although I mostly sat with Bryan’s mother, I was able to see how Bryan and Dana can minister to grieving friends and church members just by being present. Bryan is trying to teach me that one of the most important aspects to missions is, quite simply, relationships.
</p><p>
This city is part of a huge desert in Namibia, and the desert goes right up to the beach. On one side, I can see the ocean. On the other, I can see beautiful sand dunes. I was able to climb a dune – the view was amazing. Behind me were ocean waves and in front of me were waves of sand. This was like nothing I’ve seen in person before.
</p><p>
PICTURES will be inserted here... at some point.
</p><p>
I didn’t bring my camera to the top of the dune in fear of getting sand in it. However, Bryan said we would come back to this city and I will get to see greater views than I saw today.
</p><p>
Although this country is a desert, it is amazing what you can visually experience here. It’s awesome how diverse God is in his creation – even in just the landscapes.
</p><p>
When we got back to Windhoek, I was able to get online for the first time since Saturday night in Houston. I had about 30 real emails which I needed to handle – wooh wooh. However, I was able to get a lot of that taken care of, as well as add email addresses to my mailing list, and set up my skype account.
</p><p>
With Skype, I am able to call phones in the US for merely 2.5 cents per minute - and the quality is great. I also set up a phone number which allows people to call me at no charge to myself (other than the $12 I paid for 3 months of the number). If you would like to get this number or my account name, email me. Supposedly, you can leave a voicemail. This is great since it is very unlikely that I will be online when someone calls.
</p><p>
Perhaps when things are not so new to me, I won’t post as often.
</p><p>
Tomorrow is supposed to be pretty uneventful, and will be the first day for me to try to catch up on sleep.
</p><p>
Same prayer requests as yesterday…
</p>
<blockquote>Please pray that I would learn the culture quickly, that I would develop meaningful relationships with my team and the youth, and that I will be open to what the Lord wants to teach me through my experiences and through Bryan’s discipleship.</blockquote>
<p>
Also pray that tomorrow indeed is restful, as things will begin to pick up quickly on Sunday.
