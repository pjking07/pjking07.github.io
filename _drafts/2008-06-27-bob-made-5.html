<p><em>The following is a true story.</em></p>
<p>
Meet Bob. Bob is sitting at the corner of an intersection. He's holding a sign, but he's not sure if it's his.
</p>
<blockquote>
Homeless<br />
Vietnam Vet<br />
Need Food<br />
God Bless</blockquote>
<p>
Meet PJ and Katie. They brought Bob food and are talking with him. They realize Bob is not actually hungry because he does not want the tacos, apple, banana, or water - just the grapes. Bob likes grapes.
</p><p>
A lady in a car rolls down her window and hands Bob five dollars, telling him, "God Bless!".
</p><p>
As the lady drives away, Bob looks at the five dollars and says (mostly to himself), "I just made five dollars."
</p><p>
PJ looks at Bob, knowing, by Bob's own confession, that he is an alcoholic. "Bob," PJ said, "what are you going to do with that five dollars?"
</p><p>
"I'm gonna buy me some whiskey!"
