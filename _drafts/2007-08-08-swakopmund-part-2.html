<p>Also to repeat an event from earlier this summer, I went to Swakopmund (previously mentioned <a href="/2007/05/funeral-amongst-sand-dunes.html">here</a>). After the Woodway team left, Bryan wanted to take me to see this beautiful town again – and I agreed that I needed the holiday. We went for one night and stayed at a friend’s beach house (well, near-the-beach house).
</p><p>
The most memorable time from that short trip was when Bryan and I rented ATVs (a.k.a. quad-bikes, a.k.a. four-wheelers) and drove on the dunes for an hour. We had a guide, but he stretched us, so we got to do some really cool stuff. This was actually my first time to drive a four-wheeler, so it was extra awesome. The dunes were amazing, and I’m thankful I was able to experience them in this special way.

These are the dunes we drove on. Amazing, isn’t it?
