<p>I'm going to Las Vegas this week for a work sponsored developer's convention, therefore, I do not expect to post this week. As an early treat, here is another YWAP video.
</p><p>
This video is of YWAP Camp. This will also feature faces from Highland Baptist, because camp occurred on the last weekend of that team's trip.
</p><p>
This summer's camp was highly successful and ministered to 200 students. Much credit should be given to the missionaries and the rest of the YWAP staff (and many YWAP parents) for all the administrative, musical, recreational, teaching and prayerful effort they put into making the camp happen.
</p><p>
The theme of camp was "Aliens" as the opening song (by <a href="http://www.pillarontherock.com/2010/03/bride-lecrae.html">Lecrae</a>) signifies.

Also, I will be getting married in 7 weeks. Whoop!
