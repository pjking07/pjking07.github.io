<p>This past Monday, a youth team from FBC Woodway arrived. I already knew most of the people on the team – which included my mother. Their trip, although short, will have a deep impact on each of the American students.
</p><p>
Tuesday through Friday, the Woodway team gave skit and song performances at schools to promote YWAP, our local (Namibian) youth ministry. The response from the schools has been the best I’ve seen from a team so far (this is my third team to be with…). Senior High YWAP had 60 more students than normal, a 50% increase. The Junior High YWAP also saw a significant increase in numbers tonight.
</p><p>
For three days, the team also visited Beautiful Gate (previously mentioned <a href="/2007/06/but-what-about-children.html">here</a>), working with 3 – 6 year old orphans for two hours each day. Thursday night, Woodway also helped with the Beautiful Gate youth outreach, which is done weekly. The team was able to perform their school program for these kids and was once again well received.
</p><p>
It has been a very busy week (we were at schools by 7 AM and would send the team to their host homes at 8 PM). Now that the school performances and two YWAPs are over, the team is heading into tourism mode.
</p><p>
Sunday, we will have church and then drive up a mountain to have a cookout while the sun sets over the city.
</p><p>
Monday – Wednesday we will head to the Etosha game reserve to watch all the wild animals. I went to Etosha four years ago, and the animals there are amazing!
</p><p>
On Thursday, August 2, the Woodway team leaves. I will then leave Namibia on Thursday, August 9. My time here is soon coming to an end.
</p><p>
My spider bite is fine now. Thank you for your prayers. Please pray that I will be able to rest and enjoy the team (and my mother) for the next few days.
