<p>In <em>Πολιτεία</em> (<em>Republic</em>), Plato argues in favor of a society which believes a γενναῖον ψεῦδος (noble lie or royal lie) so that the people will be &quot;more inclined to care for the state and one another&quot; (Book 3, 415d).  The lie exists to give the people a false loyalty to the Republic and a false hope in its justice. Plato seems to believe that telling the lie is morally right based on a utilitarian ethic. Christopher Nolan's <em>The Dark Knight</em> concludes with two noble lies: 1) Batman killed Harvey Dent, and 2) Rachel Dawes chose to be with Bruce Wayne. The first lie is initiated by Batman and perpetuated by Jim Gordon toward the City of Gotham, while the second lie is the sole doing of Alfred Pennyworth toward Bruce Wayne. The utilitarian logic behind both of these lies is stated by Batman in the closing scenes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the truth isn't good enough. Sometimes people deserve more. Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How Will Gotham Respond?</h2>
<p>While there are utilitarian arguments promoting incidental lying in order to bring about greater moral good, creating a systemic noble lie appears flawed from the start. Building a societal foundation upon a lie may seem helpful in the short-term, but will ultimately fail in the long-term. What will happen when a society discovers that its foundation is a lie? If it becomes known at critical-mass, then the society will fall apart, igniting dissent and revolution. In this way, the noble lie fails to live up to the intention of providing a <em>good</em> foundation based upon a false hope; the societal foundation is wrong as evidenced by the long-term consequence. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, the noble lie is an objective failure because the good results expected to occur in the short-term will likely be outweighed by the bad results expected in the long-term. </p>
<p>Most ethical models (including forms of utilitarianism) uphold truth-telling as the morally right action in non-conflicting situations. Gordon pronounced a dilemma regarding Dent's craze and death:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Joker won. Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for: undone. Whatever chance you gave us at fixing our city dies with Harvey's reputation. We bet it all on him. The Joker took the best of us and tore him down. People will lose hope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Batman responds with a noble lie based on one requirement: &quot;people must never know what [Dent] did.&quot; This impossible requirement is the flaw in Batman's utilitarian decision; the truth is too likely to become known. If Gotham's chances for being &quot;fixed&quot; died with Dent's reputation (itself an unnecessary prediction), then how much more would Gotham's sense of justice suffer when it discovers the truth of Harvey Dent <em>and</em> the cover-up perpetrated by Jim Gordon and Batman? While Batman's objective moral failure in this situation does not necessarily deny the value of utilitarian ethics, it certainly casts doubt on the morality of the noble lie. From a utilitarian perspective, Batman's noble lie was well intentioned and subjectively right, but objectively wrong because of the unpredictable, negative long-term effects.</p>
<h2>Interpreting Batman with Batman</h2>
<p>A moral decision based on the utilitarian ethic cannot be deemed absolutely right or wrong until the consequences of the action come to fruition. While the indefinite future effects of actions in reality prevent moral actions from being judged absolutely under a utilitarian ethic, actions can be judged successfully within a closed story. The consequences portrayed in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> allow the audience to judge absolutely the morality of the noble lies in <em>The Dark Knight</em>. </p>
<p>Because Bane recognized that the revelation of the noble lie would spark a public outcry at the injustice that the Triumvirate (Batman, Gordon, and Dent) had perpetrated against the city, Bane announced to the captured Gotham City (and news media) that Jim Gordon had lied concerning Batman and Harvey Dent. Bane was able to utilize Batman's (and Gordon’s) objective moral failure toward his own evil ends. The masses responded to the revelation of the noble lie by releasing the prisoners from Blackgate Prison, ransacking the elite of the city, and ruling the city by anarchy. Because each of these morally bad consequences went against the intentions of Batman and outweighed the temporary moral good from the prior 8 years (between movies), Batman's noble lie can be judged by the utilitarian ethic to be an absolute moral failure. In a virtue-based critique of Gordon's perpetuation of the noble lie, John Blake stated that all the good from the Harvey Dent Act was based on a lie and Gordon betrayed everything for which he stood. When Gordon protested, Blake continued, &quot;Your hands look plenty filthy to me, commissioner.&quot;</p>
<p>The second noble lie shown at the end of <em>The Dark Knight</em> occurred when Alfred burned the letter from Rachel Dawes communicating to Bruce Wayne that she had chosen to be with Harvey Dent. In a scene in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, Alfred reveals to Bruce both his deception and his moral intention; he burned Rachel's letter in order to spare Bruce pain. However, within this scene, Alfred realizes that the consequences of his action did not match his intention: Bruce had become reclusive because of Alfred's deception. From this realization, Alfred decides to tell the truth about Rachel, not because he believes truth-telling to be virtuous, but because he predicts a better consequence from telling the truth, namely, saving Bruce's life. In the final analysis, Alfred's noble lie caused both eight years of unnecessary suffering for Bruce and Bruce's current feelings of hatred toward Alfred for telling the lie in the first place. The consequences in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> show that Alfred's noble lie was an absolute moral failure according the very utilitarian ethic he used. Ironically, although Bruce Wayne / Batman willingly deceived the public with a noble lie, he was not appreciative when a noble lie was perpetrated against him. Because Bruce’s and Alfred’s actions caused unintended consequences which were clearly worse than the presumed consequences of telling the truth, utilitarian ethics would judge that their individual uses of the noble lie failed morally, both objectively and absolutely.</p>
