<p>Hello!
</p><p>
This is Katie filling in for PJ today.  PJ and the Highland team are at camp this weekend with about 200 students.  Please be praying for wisdom for the staff and the Highland team as they serve and love the kids at camp.  Pray that the students' hearts will be open to the Lord as God continues His awesome work in Namibia!
