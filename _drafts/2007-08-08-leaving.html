<p>This is my last post from Namibia. Tomorrow, at 12:50 PM, I will lift off from Windhoek to begin my 28 hour journey to Houston. Perhaps surprisingly to you, 28 hours is an extremely short trip for this distance – my layovers are perfect.
</p><p>
My time in Namibia has been great. I was on a team which led both a youth ministry and a church. I was involved with this church at a time when Namibian leadership (eldership) was really starting to be an option. I have been able to see how African urban culture conflicts and agrees with American urban culture – especially from the youth side.
</p><p>
I have been loved by a family, accepted by a church, and befriended by many youth. I have learned how to be a big brother for the past 3 months. I have learned how to paint, how to catalog a library, and a bit about carpentry.
</p><p>
I have learned the effort that goes in to running a youth ministry and a small church. I have seen the effort it takes to minister to people constantly. I have seen the hours that are spent preparing for a weekend youth camp, and a two-week team visit.
</p><p>
I have seen Wacoans come from the other side of the world. I have taught people from my city some of the culture of Namibia.
</p><p>
I have learned to love Katie from half a world away, to persevere in a three-month separation.
</p><p>
I have learned to love my God from Africa, as I had previously done from Texas.
</p><p>
I have learned that friends can be made in all places and that relationships are what keep us going.
</p><p>
Thank you for supporting me in this ministry. I will continue to post (even about Namibia) when I get back to the States (and Oklahoma, this time). Thank you for your prayers and your letters.
