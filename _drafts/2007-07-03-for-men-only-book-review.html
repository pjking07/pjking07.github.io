<p><em>For Men Only: A Straightforward Guide to the Inner Lives of Women</em>, written by Jeff and Shaunti Feldhahn, is the companion book to the previously written <em>For Women Only</em> by Shaunti Feldhahn.
</p><p>
I purchased this book because I needed to spend $5 more to get my Amazon free shipping. I figured paying $7 for a book was more beneficial than paying $5 for shipping. I found this to be a worthwhile investment.
</p><p>
The back of the book entices you with “finally. you can understand her,” and the authors followed that promise relatively well. This 190 page book delivers eight easy-to-read chapters going through unique characteristics about women which men have difficulty understanding.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Rethinking Random: Why you need a new map of the female universe.</li>
<li>The Deal is Never Closed: Why her “I do” will always mean “Do you?” and what to do about it.</li>
<li>Windows… Open! – What you should know about the fabulous female brain.</li>
<li>Your Real Job is Closer to Home – How your provider/protector instinct can leave her feeling more unsafe and less cared for.</li>
<li>Listening is the Solution – Why her “feelings” about the problem <em>is</em> the problem, and how to fix your urge to fix.</li>
<li>With Sex, Her “No” Doesn’t Mean You – How her desires are impacted by her unique wiring, and why your ego shouldn’t be.</li>
<li>The Girl in the Mirror – What the little girl inside your woman is dying to hear from you – and how to guard your answer well.</li>
<li>The Man She had Hoped to Marry – What the woman who loves you most, most wants you to know.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I previously understood some of these issues (well, understood as well as a single guy can) while others are a little new to me. The biggest problem with this book (and others like it) is that it is based on a generalization of women. Of course, stereotyping is the necessary approach, but you must not assume that your woman is the stereotypical woman. There are some concepts presented in this book which I <em>know</em> Katie doesn’t follow. The Feldhahns warn in the introduction that your wife may not exactly match the emotional map presented, which is an essential point to remember.
</p><p>
To research for this book, the Feldhahns did extensive surveys of women. Many of the results are scattered throughout the book. The statistics do well in driving home the points the authors make.
</p><p>
What I loved the most about <em>For Men Only</em>, which is not a theology book, is that it takes an explicitly Biblical worldview in its interpretation of data and the concepts it presents. The book does not suggest solutions which are un-Christian and occasionally uses the Bible to support points.
</p><p>
I highly recommend this book for all men who are trying to better relate to a woman. It has the potential to teach much on how women emote. However, I can not express the importance of figuring out for yourself the issues in which your woman does not reflect the majority of women.
</p><p>
After I read <em>For Men Only</em>, I ordered a copy of <em>For Women Only</em> for Katie to read – hopefully we’ll get an accurate review of that book soon.
