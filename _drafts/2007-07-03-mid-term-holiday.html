<p>Well, we’re just finishing up another holiday here in Windhoek. The schools here run on 3 terms, with long holidays (4 weeks?) at the end of each term and short holidays (< 1 week) during the middle of each term. I like that there is always a holiday on the horizon so one can rejuvenate soon, rather than having to wait so long for too long of a summer break.

Amber and I stayed at home (and were baby-sat by Sybille) while Bryan, Dana and Chad went to George, South Africa for an IMB conference. They all left Friday, Dana and Chad got back Monday and Bryan will be out until Friday.

Because of the holiday, we didn’t have YWAP this past weekend. In the mean time, I have been trying to catch up on rest from when the team was here as well as reading and administrative tasks that needed to be done. That, and I spent a considerable amount of the weekend at a LAN with my YWAP friends - my clan got 2nd place in Call of Duty 2!

Tomorrow, we start working again. I think I will be starting my major project of organizing the mission’s library (which is randomly piled in closets throughout the office). We will also be working on the YWAP camp video.

Pray that I will be reminded of my purpose here, because being away from my fiancée for so long (with 38 days to go) is hard on my emotions. However, once the FBC Woodway team gets here, I think my time will fly by. So I need to persevere for the next 2.5 weeks until they get here.
