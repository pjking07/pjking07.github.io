<p>Scientific theory or research that allows for the possibility of a Creator has been systematically shunned in the academic community this generation. Professors publicly holding to the possibility of a Creator do not get tenure and scholars do not get published. This problem is apparent even at the public school level when teachers in Kansas are prohibited from mentioning that there are two sides to the evolution debate.

Ben Stein has created a documentary entitled <em>Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed</em>." Below is a long trailer to the documentary - release date is currently April 18.

Don't assume that this documentary will be Christian "propoganda" against Darwinism. It won't be - Ben Stein is Jewish. It will simply show the general public what kind of persecution academics are suffering just for questioning Darwinian thought.
