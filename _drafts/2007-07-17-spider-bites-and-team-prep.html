<p>I know it’s been a while since I last updated…

Things are going well here. Next Monday, the Woodway team will arrive. That day and the following 10 will be quite busy with all of their school performances, time at Beautiful Gate and visit to Etosha. I can’t wait to post some of the pictures I’ll get in Etosha (a wildlife preserve).

I’ve now finished organizing all the books in Bryan’s office and am waiting on the new shelves to be delivered. I am now working on cataloging all the books inside the house (about 200 titles) – so that will take a lot of time.

This weekend we will be showing the Camp videos at YWAP. I made a picture video and Brendan (the media / worship guy) is making a film video. My video is almost 14 minutes long. I’d love to post them sometime (when I have access to high-speed internet).

Today, I discovered what seems to be a spider bite on my leg. It is currently smaller than a dime, so no worries, yet. We’ve put antiseptic on it with a plaster (band-aid) and expect it to start shrinking. We are only concerned if it keeps growing. Please pray for healing.

I have 3.5 weeks left in Namibia. Pray that God will make that time great.
