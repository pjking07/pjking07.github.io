I think I’m having computer withdrawal. I used to check my email first thing in the morning, right before I went to bed and many, many times in between.
I have been on the internet once since I got here, and that for 5 minutes to call my family (and Katie… who will, from now on, be included in “family.”)
In fact, I am typing this post while not on the internet. I am writing it in Word on my laptop and will post this on my blog later. Actually, it’s 11:08 PM on May 15 – now you will be able to see if I was able to post-date this entry.

Note: Namibians use a 24-hour style for their timestamps. I’ve had a 24-hour clock on my watch for many years now. Most of my times will be written in 24-hour style on this blog.
Also, I am on GMT time. Central time is GMT – 6 hours.

I met my missionary host in the Windhoek airport around 19:00 Monday night. This meeting concluded over 24 hours of traveling – and of being around no one I knew. The layovers were good, but the 2nd of the 3 flights – the one from DC to Jo-burg – was 15 hours long!! I had no idea the flight would be that long; I was expecting something more like 13. The South African Airways flight did have a sweet video system, though. It allows you (in economy class) to pick which movie you want to watch ON DEMAND. You can pause it and everything. It certainly helped the time go by faster (especially since I didn’t sleep much). I got to watch The Pursuit of Happyness – and it’s definitely worth seeing.
I got to meet a seminarian from Bob Jones University on my layover in South Africa – we had a good conversation. That definitely helped with the 3 hour layover.

I’ve been at the missionaries’ house for about a day now. The household includes Bryan and Dana and their son, Chad – a junior in high school. They have 3 older children who now live in the States. For the next few days, Bryan’s mother is also here.
</p><p>
Since so many of their children have moved out, the missionaries offered me a room of my own – fit with an empty closet, chest of drawers, a full-size bed, and fully-loaded book shelf. I hope to add a picture once I am fully unpacked.
</p><p>
The school system is year-round here and currently the students are on a one-week holiday. That, combined with the grandmother staying here, the house has been pretty relaxed. I have needed some relaxation pretty badly recently – I know this summer will rejuvenate my spirit. Things will get up-to-speed however, when school resumes.
</p><p>
Today, I ran a few errands with Bryan and mostly worked on learning the culture and meeting some of the youth team. If you don’t already know, Windhoek is the capital city of Namibia. I am living in an urban environment, which is pretty similar to Waco. Also, the official language here is English (although there are many different languages spoken throughout the country and city). Therefore, I will not have to be learning language while I am here.
</p><p>
It’s so peaceful here right now. I know I am going to love my summer here.
</p><p>
Please pray that I would learn the culture quickly, that I would develop meaningful relationships with my team and the youth, and that I will be open to what the Lord wants to teach me through my experiences and through Bryan’s discipleship.
