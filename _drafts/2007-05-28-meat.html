<p>A week ago, last Sunday, was my first day of church in Namibia. Afterwards, my family and I ate with other families at someone’s home. For lunch, we had MEAT.

We had lamb ribs and lamb other-parts. It was good meat, and there was a lot of it. I was happy.

Also at lunch was a lawyer from Zambia, who is living in Windhoek for a multi-year trial. The really interesting thing about him is that he is also an accomplished Zambian folk singer. In the mid-nineties, he was the most popular folk singer in the country, and was consistently being played on TV and radio. He played his two most popular songs for us and they were great. It’s amazing getting to know the people of this city.
