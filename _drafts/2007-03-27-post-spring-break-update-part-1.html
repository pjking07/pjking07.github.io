<p>Hey everybody, 
</p><p>
I came back to College Station Monday of this week. That means I stayed overnight in towns other than College Station 12 nights in a row... and 8 of those nights were NOT during my spring break. It's amazing that the Lord changed my schedule so I could see Katie as much as I did. I didn't even really skip a beat when I got back to school. I guess that's the good part of taking only 8 hours this semester... 
</p><p>
I visited Katie in Norman toward the end of my spring break. While there, we picked out a townhome. I'll live there in September by myself and she'll move-in after we get married. The townhome is two levels with two bedrooms upstairs. The kitchen seemed big enough and the dining area actually allows room for a small table (which is better than some other apartments we looked at). The stairs are cliff style and underneath is open. Therefore we will be able to use that space for storage if need be (which is awesome... especially considering my Star Wars collection). One side of the home has a fire-wall that is completely red brick. Below is a floorplan. The actual townhome we're going to get is a mirror image of the plans.

<p>It's 1100 sq. ft. - which is the biggest apartment we looked at - and the rent is the middle of our preferred range. Katie and I are pretty satisfied so far - now we just have to wait until I move in to see how much we really like it.

I don't like reading long posts, so I'm going to cut this one off here and talk about the rest of my break later.
