<p>Monday, the Highland team left to go home to Waco. It is really different not having them around anymore. We were with these 18 people all day, every day for almost two weeks.
</p><p>
The team did a great job. Four of the days they were here, they visited local schools and gave assemblies. Their show included skits, a band and short talks. The students really responded to the Highland team.
</p><p>
The Highlanders also served at the Beautiful Gate orphanage I mentioned <a href="/2007/06/but-what-about-children.html">earlier</a>. They really loved on the kids while we were there.
</p><p>
Also, as mentioned <a href="/2007/06/ywap-camp.html">earlier</a>, the team went YWAP to camp. There, great friendships were made between the Namibians and the Texans.
</p><p>
We miss the team being here, but now we have to get back to our daily routines here in Windhoek.
