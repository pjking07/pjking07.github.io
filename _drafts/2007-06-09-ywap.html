Last weekend was my first weekend to do YWAP (Youth with a Purpose). Friday nights, we host Senior YWAP (age 15 – 21) and Saturday nights, we host Junior YWAP (age 10 – 14).
</p><p>
For my first YWAP, I was asked to give a testimony. Half of my talk was about parts of my life – and the other half was explaining the three phases of salvation – justification, sanctification, and glorification. I called it a quick theology word lesson, because sanctification was the theme to the testimony I was giving. I won’t be posting the personal parts of my testimony but, perhaps, I will post the theology part soon. <em>[Update: <a href="/2007/06/testimony-excerpt.html">here it is</a>]</em>
</p><p>
For now, I seem to have 2 main responsibilities at YWAP – relate with the kids and have media presentations for every week. Last week, I took pictures so that this week, I could have a video to present...

Currently, I’m editing a video drama. I’m hoping to complete it before Ronny’s team gets here on Tuesday (so soon...).
</p><p>
Most of my relating with the kids has been the standard hanging out with them, be it talking or playing soccer. However, last night, a girl approached me to talk about issues she is having that I described in my testimony (distance from God and such). So we walked to a highly visible, yet audibly private place.
</p><p>
Now, I’m not experienced in counseling (but I always have an opinion on what people should do…) – so I gave it a shot. When she started talking about how distant she felt and how she wasn’t passionate about the spiritual disciplines, I was thinking “Wow, I really have no idea what to tell her – and yet, she’s looking at me and is expecting some profound advice.”
</p><p>So I stalled. I started praying for God to show me what he wanted to reveal to her. And while I had no idea what to say, I started telling her the different things other people would tell her. The Lord then told me to talk about the importance of community, and how she’s not experiencing community if none of her friends or family knows she’s struggling with this. That, eventually, led to what I think is the bigger problem. I told her to pray about this bigger problem and to talk to her parents about it.
</p><p>I need to get back to editing. Pray that I will be a good witness for the students. Pray that I will refrain from sin.
