<p>My first assignment with Bryan required me to learn a new trade; for three days, I learned how to paint. And what better is there to learn on than Bryan’s office?
</p><p>
What started out as a dirty (from use) white, is now some-special-name blue (I only know a few color names… they all look the same to me). We’re 98% done, and Bryan is really pleased with how it came out.

<p>I won’t say more, because – seriously – I was painting… there’s just not much more to say than that.
