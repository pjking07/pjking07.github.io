<p>This past weekend, YWAP hosted a 200-person camp at a training center about 45 minutes outside of town. The Highland team was there for camp, and although they were involved with some of the skits and worship, they were considered campers for the weekend.

One of the highlights of the camp was the worship sets. The worship time seemed to really have a moving of the Spirit.

During camp, I was the filmographer. I held a camcorder in my hand almost the entire time. While filming is fun at first, after doing it for many, many hours in one weekend it can become a chore. However, I am glad that I was able to serve in that way. We will be making a camp video soon. I know it will be great.

Thank you for your prayers during camp. That weekend, many students professed to believe in the power of Christ for the first time. The church now has the task of nursing these new believers into maturity. Pray that the church will persevere in this.</p><p class="sig">
