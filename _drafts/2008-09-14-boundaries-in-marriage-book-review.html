Drs. Henry Cloud and John Townsend coauthored <em>Boundaries in Marriage</em>. Both authors maintain private practices in clinical psychology in Newport Beach, California. Cloud earned a B.S. in Psychology from Southern Methodist University and a PhD in clinical psychology from Biola University. Townsend earned a B.A. in Psychology from North Carolina State University, a Master of Theology from Dallas Theological Seminary, and a PhD in clinical psychology from Biola University.</p>
<p>
<em>Boundaries in Marriage</em> is one book in a series which also includes: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Boundaries</em> </li>
<li><em>Boundaries in Dating</em> </li>
<li><em>Boundaries with Teens</em> </li>
<li><em>Boundaries with Kids</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>
This book is divided into 16 chapters. The middle section (specifically, chapters 5 - 13) provides advice to married couples on concepts such as love, honesty, faithfulness, compassion, forgiveness, holiness, and resolving conflict. These chapters contain good, straight-forward advice which is easy to apply. However, these chapters with the best material were supported by the least unique concepts. It would be simple to find better Christian marriage books which presented this same material.</p>
<p>
While chapters 1-4 and 14-16 do offer something unique to the marriage discussion, most of the content is taken straight from the original <em>Boundaries</em> book and applied to marriage. Some of this material is acceptable, but a minority of the advice in these chapters is badly edited or unhelpful. Because the middle chapters are uncontroversial and easily replaced with other books, I will focus on these problematic sections instead.</p>
<p>
The authors claim, “This book is not about <em>changing</em>, fixing, or making your spouse do anything.”<a class="note" href="#1" name="1-ret">1</a> While I whole-heartedly agree with the premise—it emphasizes that spouses should act lovingly towards each other, regardless of reciprocity—this concept was contradicted many times throughout the book, as when the authors wrote, "[Boundaries] are to protect and structure you, and only secondarily to <em>change</em> and motivate him."<a class="note" href="#2" name="2-ret">2</a></p>
<p>
Given the authors’ credentials, I was hoping to find biblical teachings in this book, but I ultimately found it lacking. According to Cloud and Townsend, there are "Ten Laws of Boundaries;" the second "Law" is of "Responsibility." This law states, &quot;We are responsible <em>to</em> each other, but not <em>for</em> each other.&quot;<a class="note" href="#3" name="3-ret">3</a> This presents a problem in light of Ephesians 5:23, &quot;For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He himself being the Savior of the body.&quot; Because Christ is the head and savior of the church, He is responsible for the church, and particularly, for her sins. To properly relate the headship of Christ over His church to the headship of a husband over his wife, the husband must be responsible for his wife.</p>
<p>
While the "Law of Responsibility" might be valid in most relationships, it is completely <em>invalid</em> in the relationship of a husband to his wife. Interestingly, the final chapter essentially affirms my argument—referring to <cite class="bibleref" title="Ephesians 5:22-23, 25">Ephesians 5:22-23, 25</cite> the authors write, &quot;Basically this passage establishes a sense of order in a marriage. It places final responsibility for the family on the shoulders of the husband.&quot; Once again, the authors of this book directly contradict themselves, even contradicting one of their “Laws”. For more on the topic of a husband's responsibility for the family, I recommend Douglas Wilson's <em>Federal Husband</em> or <em>Reforming Marriage</em>.</p>
<p>
The next major fault can be found in chapter four, &quot;It Takes Two to Make One.&quot; This title points to Genesis 2:24, &quot;For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.&quot; Unfortunately, the authors take this biblical premise, and transform it into something incoherent and incorrect. Cloud and Townsend write, &quot;You must become a complete individual on your own in order to have true oneness with your spouse.&quot;<a class="note" href="#4" name="4-ret">4</a> Indeed, the authors seem to view a ‘complete individual’ as one who can perform tasks in all domains of life: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You may have heard couples say, &quot;We are such a good balance for each other.&quot; This can be good if, for example, he is good at business and she is good at building the nest, or vice versa. But it is not good if it means that she could not survive in the real world of work and commerce on her own without him. If this is true, she has married a &quot;meal ticket,&quot; or someone to take care of her in a childlike dependency. And he has married a &quot;mother&quot; to make the home that he could not build for himself while he goes off and plays during the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, this is well-intentioned and partly on the right track, but the authors ultimately go off the rails. Genesis 2:24 doesn’t qualify ‘one flesh;’ there are no requirements on the ‘completeness’ of the husband nor the wife. A man and wife are ‘one’ in <em>all</em> marriages, regardless of the problems of each individual spouse. It disturbs me that the authors push the idea that, in order to be a &quot;complete&quot; individual, the woman must have business acumen and the man must be part domestic-diva.</p>
<p>
Throughout my reading, I noticed that the authors studiously avoided the topic of submission in marriage. The final chapter, &quot;Avoiding the Misuse of Boundaries in Marriages,&quot; which does devote three pages to the topic, only slightly remedied this problem. The authors' take on submission is fairly healthy, but its placement in the book minimizes its impact and suggests that submission is merely an afterthought in the context of <em>Boundaries</em>.</p>
<p>
As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, there is some good material <em>Boundaries in Marriage</em>. The best advice put forward is <em>ownership</em>; Cloud and Townsend teach that <em>you</em> need to own your actions toward your spouse. More importantly, no matter what your spouse does toward you, you must own your reactions to the situation. This is excellent advice for holy living in general and is a great nugget of wisdom for marriage, specifically.</p>
<p>
In summary, <em>Boundaries in Marriage</em> is a poorly edited book with many contradictions. The good advice is not unique, and the unique advice is not good.</p>
