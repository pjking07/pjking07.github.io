<p>My missionary family once had four kids living at home. Now that only Chad is there, empty bedrooms abound. I have been graced with my own bedroom for the summer, complete with a full bed, full bookshelf, empty dressers, and an empty closet. At my request, we also brought in a folding table to serve as my much-needed computer desk.
