Some people have asked me to post an update about my family's life...<br/>
</p><p>
My family only includes me and Katie for now. We also have a dog, Luke Skywalker, but he's not part of the family; he's a pet.
</p><p>
Katie started <a href="http://nursing.ouhsc.edu/">OU Nursing School</a> in Oklahoma City this semester. In May of 2010, she plans to have a B.S. in Nursing and be licensed as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_nurse">R.N.</a>
</p><p>
Nursing school is hardâ€”it's actually hard on both of us. Katie had the summer off and didn't work or take any classes. It was wonderful for me; she had lots of time to spend with me when I came home from work. Nursing school is quite different. Katie spends 60 hours a week at school or doing homework. (Thankfully, she is able to always keep our weekly date night free from school-work.)
</p><p>
I think we've had three phases of adjustment to school. For the first week, I struggled greatly with not getting so much free-time from my wife. After realizing my selfishness in some areas, I've done much better. The second phase was when nursing school still felt new. The newness helped ease the stress of my wife's intense schooling. Now, we are in the last phase. This phase is when we finally realize that nursing school is difficult for both of us - period. We're at the point that (almost) every day is hard and we now realize that we must rely on Christ's strength in order to persevere through this phase of life.
</p><p>
We're quite thankful that Katie will have over a month off for Christmas (which will include our first anniversary). That will be a needed time for us to recover from this first semester.
</p><p>
Perhaps, at another time, I will tell you why we believe God has called us to put Katie through nursing school.
</p><p>
Please pray that our marriage would be strengthened by this trial and that we would continue to press more deeply into Christ.
