<p>I'm sorry that I abruptly dropped off from posting when I left Africa. Since then, I have been quite a busy person with moving to Oklahoma, starting a new job, and helping Katie plan a wedding...
</p><p>
I still have not decided if I will make time to consistently post here, however, I do have some videos I would like to share from my trip.
</p><p>
While I was in Namibia, I made videos for (and of) YWAP. Now that I have a high-speed internet connection (which I was lacking in Africa), I have been able to upload the videos.
</p><p>
The videos are 5-7 minutes each, so I'm only going to post one video at a time...
I posted my first YWAP <a href="/2007/06/ywap.html">video</a> earlier in the summer.
</p><p>
This video was made for the July 28, 2007 edition of YWAP.  You Wacoans may see some familiar faces in the video below. <em>[Edit: the picture show with Wacoans is actually <a href="/2007/11/videos-part-2.html">here</a>]</em>
