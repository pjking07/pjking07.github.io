<p>The story of Jonah is a pitiful tale of a prophet who rightly understands God to be merciful, but so hates his enemies that he goes to great lengths to stop the mercy of God from going forth to them. The book concludes with God exposing Jonah's sinful disdain for the people of Nineveh via the life and death of a leafy plant. Indeed, Jonah's pity for a perished plant is strongly contrasted against his indignation about the salvation of a wicked city. Having received mercy from God, Jonah was grateful for his own life, but when the Ninevites received mercy, Jonah wished for his own death.</p>
<p>At the beginning of <cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4">chapter 4</cite>, Jonah is angry at God for showing mercy to the newly repentant Ninevites; indeed, he believed the LORD was acting wickedly (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:1">v 1</cite>, c.f. Jonah 3:10). Jonah then prays to the LORD in his anger, which is a strong contrast to his previous prayer of thankfulness while in the belly of the fish (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:2">v 2</cite>, c.f. <cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 2">Jonah 2</cite>). Ironically, Jonah shows his nature as a prophet by correctly identifying that the LORD would be gracious and merciful to a repentant Nineveh. However, Jonah is angry with God about his very nature in being slow to anger and showing steadfast love toward even this city (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:2">v 2</cite>, c.f. Exodus 34:6-7, Joel 2:13, Nehemiah 9:17, Psalm 145:8). Indeed, Jonah would rather die than see Nineveh be saved from God's wrath (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:3">v 3</cite>). Following this prayer, the LORD rhetorically asks Jonah if he does well to be angry about Nineveh's redemption (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:4">v 4</cite>), a clear example of God's patience with Jonah, despite his wickedness.</p>
<p>Following his angry prayer, Jonah encamps outside the city of Nineveh with the vain hope of watching its destruction (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:5">v 5</cite>). Here, the LORD appoints a shady plant in order to save Jonah from his own wickedness (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:6">v 6</cite>, c.f. <cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:1">v 1</cite>). The life of the plant makes Jonah rejoice, which is an explicit contrast to his condemnation of God for saving Nineveh (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:6">v 6</cite>, c.f. <cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:1">v 1</cite>). The next day, God appoints the combination of a scorching wind, an exceedingly hot sun, and the death of the plant via a worm in order to make Jonah faint (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:7-8">v 7-8</cite>). Because of his sudden displeasure, Jonah again proclaims that he would be better off deadâ€”all while hoping to watch the destruction of Nineveh (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:8">v 8</cite>, c.f. <cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:3">v 3</cite>)! Again, the LORD asks if Jonah does well to be angry (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:9">v 9</cite>, c.f. <cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:4">v 4</cite>). Even still, Jonah claims that he is right in his indignation toward God and would rather die (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:9">v 9</cite>). Again, the LORD shows his patience toward Jonah's sinfulness.</p>
<p>Finally, the LORD reveals to Jonah the purpose of the plant, a creature which Jonah pitied though it lived only for a day (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:10">v 10</cite>). As a comparison, God rhetorically asks Jonah why he should not pity Nineveh, a morally confused city of 120,000 people whom God created. To further expose Jonah's sin, the LORD asks if the numerous cattle should not at least be spared, possibly to compare Jonah's pity toward the plant (<cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4:11">v 11</cite>).</p>
<p>The significance of <cite class="bibleref" title="Jonah 4">Jonah 4</cite> is the demonstration of the LORD's slowness to anger and his steadfast love for all who will repent, whether Israelite, prophet, or heathen. Jonah's own inconsistency is obvious as he longs for the quick destruction of his wicked neighbors, but rejoices in the forgiveness which God extended toward him despite his own sin. Indeed, the LORD has a heart for all peoples and has called his covenant people to love them as well (c.f. Luke 10:25-37, Matthew 22:39, Leviticus 19:18).</p>
