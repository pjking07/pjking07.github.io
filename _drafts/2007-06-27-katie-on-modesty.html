<p>Katie Carroll (my bride-to-be) has been writing an ongoing series on modesty. Most recently she has written a two-part post on a highly controversial topic - swimsuits.
</p><p>
For the past year, Katie has been seriously following the Lord and seeking His will on the modesty issue. When she concludes the series, I will link back to all the posts. For now, we will look at the swimsuit posts.

<br />
In this first post, Katie asks and answers the question: Are modern female swimsuits appropriate to be worn in the presence of men?

<br />
In this second post, Katie describes what she has decided to wear for a swimsuit, and her experience with it on a trip to the beach.

</ol>
<p>
I highly recommend these posts to all Christian females - and guys should find them interesting too.
</p><p>
I pray that other girls / women will follow Katie's example in this area.
