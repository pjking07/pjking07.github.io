Hey guys - 
</p><p>
I don't have time for a very insightful post right now, but I thought I'd try to keep you up to date on some things in my life.
</p><p>
I got my plane tickets in the mail yesterday; exciting... yet slightly scary that I have to keep up with them for the next 3 months (I live in a house with 4 other guys ...). 
</p><p>
Also, a big thanks to <a href="http://life-renewed.blogspot.com/index.html">Chris</a> for directing some of you to my blog. I hope that somehow the Lord may bless you through my posts. 
</p><p>
I guess I have time to offer you a story from earlier this semester (not an illustration, and probably not that interesting... just giving you the background to understand where I'm at regarding Biology):
</p><p>
I started out taking 11 hours this semester: Senior Design (for Computer Engineers), Advanced Digital Logic (ELEN), Fourier Series (Math), and Ballroom Dance (so I know how to dance for my wedding). I also had the full intention of graduating in May.
</p><p>Well, I realized Math was way over my head.&#160; It's too bad that I didn't realize this until after the standard add/drop date because I needed the class to get my math minor (I'm not getting a minor anymore) but it was also fulfilling an elective requirement for graduation.
</p><p>
So, I was freaking out about this class and my inability to do it when I decided that I just needed to drop it and figure out something else. Freshman Biology can count for the same elective as the senior math course (go figure). I knew I had the option of taking a CLEP test and getting credit for the course... however, if I failed the test, I wouldn't graduate... so I decided to enroll in the Biology course with the full intention of attempting the CLEP test and dropping the course if I passed.
</p><p>
A week and a half after classes started, I found myself in the Dean's office, pleading my case for getting forced into a freshman BIOL course 2 days after the deadline. Thanks be to God - I got in the class. One problem: I had an exam in there 10 days later. I had missed the first 3 lectures of the class, and the test covered the first 5 lectures.
</p><p>
After a very stressful weekend of studying (I was freaking out again), I was able to cover all the material. On accident, I actually covered all the material that would be on the test... before ever going to a lecture. After that initial push for the class, I also started preparing for the comprehensive CLEP test - while also finalizing my preparation for the class exam.
</p><p>
10 days after enrolling in the class, the Lord enabled me to perform well on the exam ... which leaves a good buffer in case I actually have to stay in the class.
</p><p>
One week after the class exam, I went in for the CLEP test. Now, if you don't know what the CLEP (College Level Examination Program) is... it basically lets you take a test and get college credit for it, and the specifics are determined by your school. It's a pass-fail test; failures are ignored and a pass is granted credit.
</p><p>
Once again, the Lord enabled me to perform well on the exam. The only problem now is that my scores won't be official for another 3 weeks... which is when I'm scheduled to take exam #2 for the BIOL class. Thankfully, my prof is a sweet and loving woman, and will allow me to settle the CLEP issues before requiring me to take the exam.
</p><p>
For now, I am attending class and taking notes with the hope of never having to study. I pray my credit will be finalized before Spring Break.
</p><p>
Hopefully, in a few weeks I'll have good news to offer regarding biology.
