<p>Thank you for the prayers for my health.
</p><p>
Many on the Woodway team experienced flu-like symptoms while they were here (it's flu season here in Namibia). At 8:45 PM last night, I started shaking from the chill of my fever rising. Immediately, my host family gave me tylenol and other medicines for the impending stomach problems. They also started praying for me.
</p><p>
My temperature started to rise quickly. I SMSed (texted) Katie and told her I was sick. My fever maxed out at 102.5. By the Lord's grace, my fever stayed there for only half an hour and then started dropping at the same rate it rose. By midnight, my fever was below 100 and I was able to fall asleep. When I awoke at 9:00 AM this morning, my temperature was a cool 97.4.

Although my illness was short, I was able to learn from it. Illness reminds us that we are not in control - that the Lord is our strength.
</p><p>
I must go now.
