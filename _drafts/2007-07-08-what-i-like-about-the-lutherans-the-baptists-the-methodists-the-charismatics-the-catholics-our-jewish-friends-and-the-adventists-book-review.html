<p>Once again, I am reviewing a short book – this one is just over 100 pages. It’s not that I only read short books; I just haven’t finished any of my longer books yet. I purchased this book for about $3 from a junk store – or a cheap half.com seller. Either way, I purchased it on a whim, based on its title.
</p><p>
George E. Vandeman wrote <em>What I Like About...</em>, in 1986. Now, I had never heard of Vandeman, and I have not researched him yet, either. The back of the book says that he was the director and speaker of the “It is Written” television series… whatever that is. I have not looked for his biography because my internet access here is charged by the minute – and I’d rather spend my money elsewhere.
</p><p>
Obviously, Vandeman wrote about the long list of denominations listed in the book’s title. He started each chapter with a brief history of how the denomination started, which “truth” it was rescuing, and a synopsis of the denomination’s current work. The short histories about the Lutherans, Baptists and Methodists were interesting bits and should pique the interest of one who is unfamiliar with those beginnings.
</p><p>
Vandeman clearly stated the major issues on which he agreed (and disagreed) with each chapter’s denomination. Although he gives “Our Jewish Friends” a chapter, he does not try to say they fall into some sort of Christian denomination, but rather he mostly talks about the B.C. Jewish heritage. All in all, he seemed to give a fair representation of each of the denominations discussed, that is, until he discussed the Seventh-day Adventists.
</p><p>
Vandeman is a Seventh-day Adventist, and it is incredibly clear that the point of his short book was to promote his denomination. However, the reasons he offers for being a Seventh-day Adventist are far from compelling.
</p><p>
First, he gives a short history of the Adventists - one which includes William Miller, who taught that Christ would return in 1844 and Joseph Wolff, who predicted Christ to return in 1847. Somehow, Vandeman likened the early Adventists disappointment in their false prophecies to the disciples’ discouragement in the death of Jesus. He failed to finish that comparison and did not describe that while Jesus beat death, Miller and Wolff were still wrong.
</p><p>
He then discusses how Saturday is the biblical Sabbath, while Sunday is merely the traditional Sabbath – and therefore wrong. Of course, Vandeman fails to reference where the Bible says that Saturday is the Sabbath, leaving room for one to ponder if the Saturday Sabbath is also a tradition.
</p><p>
Vandeman’s final argument for being a Seventh-day Adventist is that it is healthy. “Adventists lay aside tobacco and liquor and emphasize the advantages of exercise, fresh air, sunshine, a balanced diet, adequate rest, and trust in God… The nonalcoholic, nonsmoking Adventist lifestyle, with its appetizing natural-food diet, helps its members live six to seven years longer than the general population, according to recent surveys – with only half the cancer and heart disease.”
</p><p>
I could write more – but I would rather not waste your time. Simply put, Vandeman does not use well-constructed arguments. I highly recommend that you do not read this book.
