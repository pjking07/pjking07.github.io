<p>Unlike Senator <a href="/2008/10/inhofe-keeps-my-support.html">Jim Inhofe</a>, Representative Mary Fallin (R-OK) decided to <em>support</em> the financial bailout.
</p><p>
The only other ballot option for Oklahoma's 5th district is Steve Perry. While I do like Perry's platform on Indian Gambling Reform, there are (at least) three problems I have with him:
</p><p>
<ol>
  <li>Perry is pro-abortion:
    <blockquote>
Our society should never seek to interfere between a woman and her doctor when the issue is carrying a child to term. We should never worry more about spiritual babies than real ones or the women who must make these fateful decisions.  
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Perry probably would have voted for the bailout package.</li>
  <li>Perry would vote for more federal spending than Fallin would.</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
Perry's reference to the unborn as merely "spiritual babies" is just insulting. His language in the above quote also shows that he supports late-term abortions - abortions on viable kids.
</p><p>
Given my choices, voting for Perry is <em>clearly</em> not an option. I would argue that withholding my vote is as reckless as voting for Perry. Therefore, I will vote for Fallin, albeit, unhappily.
