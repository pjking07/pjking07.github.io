<p>At work, our "Fun Team" decided to play the "Two Truths and a Lie" game.
</p><p>
Below is a slight modification of what I submitted:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In college, PJ was a volunteer Fire Fighter for the College Station FD.</li>
<li>PJ's collegiate chorus performed the Chinese national anthem at the China-US Relations Conference in 2003</li>
<li>PJ has lived in 9 places over the past 5 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Which one is not true? Leave a comment.
