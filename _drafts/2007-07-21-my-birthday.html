On Thursday, July 19, we celebrated my birthday. I turned the incredibly old age of 22. It’s too bad, because I was finally used to saying that I am 21.

My missionary family threw a very fun party for me. Bryan, Dana (the parents) and Amber (the niece living with us) were there, of course. My friends Sybille, Riko, Brendan and Heike were also able to make it. Chad wasn’t there because he was in South Africa playing in a field hockey tournament – and he was in the hospital… but that’s a different story.

<p>We went to a place called “The Castle” for sun-downers. The sun set while we were driving to the Castle, so we actually had sun’s-already-downers. We had hot chocolate / coffee and dessert.

<p>We then went back to the house for KFC and a movie. Interestingly enough, Kentucky Fried Chicken is the only American fast food in Windhoek.

Because of my (real and Namibian) families’ efforts, I had a great birthday here in Namibia.
