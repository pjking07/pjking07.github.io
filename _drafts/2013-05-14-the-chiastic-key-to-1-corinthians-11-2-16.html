<p>Christians must concern themselves with obeying the Lord’s commandments. Do Christians disobey Scripture when they do not explicitly observe Paul’s exhortation to the Corinthians to observe the tradition of head-coverings? At first glance, the arguments Paul makes regarding headship, glory, angels, and nature makes it difficult to know if the head-covering tradition ought to be universally observed. Indeed, “this passage is full of notorious exegetical difficulties.” Despite the difficulties, this paper will demonstrate that Paul’s chiastic-structured argument uses universal truths and cultural mores to exhort the Corinthians to maintain the tradition of head-coverings within the church in order to honor headship, promote propriety, and reveal glory. His concern in this pericope is consistent with his broader concerns for the Corinthians: the church ought to be unified, loving, and mutually submissive to the glory of God.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Paul’s first canonical epistle to the Corinthians is a concerned response to reports and letters he had received regarding his beloved church. Throughout his letter, Paul exhorts the Corinthian Christians to be unified in Christ to the glory of God, demonstrated by forgoing certain liberties for the sake of the brethren. Paul even uses himself as a model for giving up one’s rights for the sake of the Church and the proclamation of the Gospel. Immediately prior to the pericope in question, Paul exhorts his audience to do all things to the glory of God, giving offense neither to believers nor non-believers, pleasing everyone, just as he attempts to do. Boldly, he then encourages his fellow Christians to imitate him as he imitates Christ (1 Cor. 10:23-11:1)! Paul then transitions into the passage in view, in which he expresses his concern for the Corinthian observation of the tradition of head-coverings in worship. Following this passage, Paul includes instructions regarding a loving Lord’s Supper, use of the spiritual gifts, an exhortation to love, and instructions for orderly worship (1 Cor. 11:17-14:40). In 1 Corinthians 11:2-16, Paul transitions from exhorting the Corinthians in their behavior in the world, to exhorting them in their behavior within the church body. As acknowledged by Thiselton, “A genuine breakthrough is offered by … the theme of self-discipline, restraint, and respect for ‘the other,’ already prominent in 8:1 – 11:1, remains central to 11:2-14:40.” The hermeneutical context for this passage must be Paul’s command to imitate him, as he imitates Christ, doing all things to the glory of God, while seeking no advantage and no offense.</p>
