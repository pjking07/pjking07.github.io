<p>These next two weeks are important for me scholastically. Next week, I have a midterm on Monday, a mid-semester report due on Tuesday, and 2 ballroom exams (written and... dancing) and a presentation on Thursday. It's great to have all that next week, as Spring Break starts that weekend (in 10 days, whoop!) and I can take the week off from school. However, <em>this</em> weekend, <a href="http://psalm-67.blogspot.com/index.html">Katie</a> is coming to town, which is great. The only problem is, I have to get ready for next week ... and seeing her throws in a huge time crunch. But it's good - I need to see her, it will have been three weeks. (18 days seems to be as long as we can go without seeing each other before it starts to be a heavy burden.) I miss her and am really excited to see her again. 
</p><p>
Considering the current state of our long distance relationship (a 6 hour drive ... seeing each other every 2 or 3 weeks) I wonder what it's going to be like when I'm in Namibia for 3 months. Three months is a little longer than 3 weeks... We tell each other that it will be easier to deal with being apart since I will be on a different continent - and since it would hugely impractical for us to see each other. Katie says it'll be easier than other situations of us being apart because she'll know I'll be doing work for the Kingdom in a way that I'll never have a chance to do again as a single. I know I'll have a little easier time when I think of all the wedding planning that's going on that I don't have to directly participate in (whoop!). I mean, I care about my wedding... but I'm a man. And all that registering for housewares... 
</p><p>
But the best part is to think that I will actually be living in Norman when I get back. I've never been able to consistently live in the same town as Katie. The longest we've had together in Waco was Christmas break in 05-06. Last summer and Christmas, I worked in College Station 3 days a week and then would come to Waco for a long weekend. Although I saw her a lot more then than I do during school, it still wasn't like living in the same town.
</p><p>
I graduate on a Friday and I fly out Sunday, two days later. Katie and I will go from seeing each other only every 2 or 3 weeks to not seeing each other for 3 months, to actually living in the same town. Now <em>that</em> is something to look forward to. The only way it could be better was if I was getting married a few days after I flew in to the states... but Katie doesn't like that idea. 
</p><p>
Another good thing about being gone for three months is that it somewhat shortens the engagement (as far as us being physically together goes). As I've heard many people say, being engaged is when you get a lot of the trials associated with marriage, but few of the benefits. I agree and am a huge fan of short engagements (and short dating, but that's another topic). 
</p><p>In summary: </p>  <p>I miss Katie. I get to see Katie this weekend. I want to get married.</p></div>
