<p>Katie and I have been married for more than a year now! Does that mean we're not newlyweds anymore?
</p><p>
For our anniversary trip, we went to San Antonio, Gruene, and New Braunfels. We stayed at a <a href="http://sanantonioriverwalk.place.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/place/index.jsp">Hyatt Place</a> on the Riverwalk for two nights and loved it. The only downside was that the weather was in the low 40s.

Now for pictures!

<p>While we were in San Antonio, we bought some Texas paraphernalia for our cars and home:

In San Antonio we ate at some great restaurants: "The Original" (Mexican) and "Rainforest Cafe". At the latter, I ordered paella. Below is a photo of a sea creature I enjoyed eating.</p>

<p>
After our two nights in San Antonio we went to Gruene, TX and stayed at the <a href="http://www.gruenehomesteadinn.com/">Gruene Homestead Inn</a> in <em>The Silo</em>. It was a fun one-time stay (annoyance: the bathroom was downstairs, the bed was upstairs). </p>

The trip was a great opportunity for us to relax after the Fall school semester and to reflect upon our first year of marriage. I would like to extend thanks to everyone who has helped us and supported us in our lives together!
