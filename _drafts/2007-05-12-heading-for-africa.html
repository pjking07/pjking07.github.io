<div class='post'>
<p>Tomorrow, I leave for Africa.
</p><p>
My life has been moving so fast these past two weeks...
</p><p>
Finishing my senior design project and graduating have been a blur...
</p><p>
I board a plane tomorrow morning - and I have not had time to realize what I'm getting into.
</p><p>
For three months I will be away from all that I'm used to, will be away from my family, my friends, my fiancee.
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>Pray that my travels will not have problems.
</li><li>Pray that I will quickly recover from 24 hours of traveling.
</li><li>Pray that I will quickly adapt to my new environment (and driving on the left side of the road).
</li></ul>
