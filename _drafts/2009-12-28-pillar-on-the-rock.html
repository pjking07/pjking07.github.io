<p>I am excited to offer to you a delayed announcement about a project that <a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com">Chris Krycho</a> and I launched on November 9: <a href="http://www.pillarontherock.com" target="_blank">Pillar on the Rock</a>. </p>

<p>The purpose of Pillar on the Rock is to show others what it is that young-adult Christians truly seek in churches. Our goal is to demonstrate that the biblical model of the church is one that <em>does</em> appeal to our generation, despite what others may say. Our passion is to help local churches reach our peers.</p>

<p>The site is going strong, with 30 posts already published. The best way to become familiar with Pillar on the Rock, would be to read its articles. My recommendation would be to start with a 3-part series I recently finished on the topic of church membership â€“ <a href="http://www.pillarontherock.com/2009/12/membership-matters-series.html">Membership Matters:</a></p>
