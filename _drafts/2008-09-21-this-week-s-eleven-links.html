<em>This Week's Eleven Links</em> is a series where I refer you to interesting,
        controversial, theological or humorous media.

                This is a customer complaint about Bratz Babyz dolls from 2006. The letter is sarcastic,
                but the sarcasm does not mask the sleaziness of the toys.

                An excerpt:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Can you tell me why these baby dolls are wearing thongs? Is this a new fad for infants?
                I'm giving these two dolls the benefit of the doubt that they're good girls forced
                to work as topless dancers to pay for formula and pacifiers. They couldn't actually
                be a dominatrix prostitute and a hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold as their outfits seem
                to imply, right?

                <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/blog_read.php?id=2459">Apologize to Charles Darwin?</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Mohler states that "a senior cleric of the Church of England wants his church
                to apologize to Charles Darwin in time for the observance of the 200th anniversary
                of Darwin's birth next year."
            </p>
            <p>
                In this commentary, Dr. Mohler offers his opinion on Rev. Brown's statement of the
                need for apology. Mohler closes with this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                People come to church hungry for the Gospel and in order to fear God, not for an
                apology offered to a self-described enemy of the faith -- who believed that faith
                in God is akin to a monkey's fear of a snake.

            <p>
                What I find interesting about this article is how the writer has trouble keeping
                up with when the subject, <em>David Schroer</em>, should be referenced as a male
                or a female. It is my (correct) opinion that just because David changed his name
                and had his penis removed does <em>not</em> mean he should be recognized as a woman.
                That's just illogical.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tell me if this sentence makes sense to you:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                After [David] Schroer had retired from the military, she applied for a job at the
                Library of Congress. Court records show that Schroer, then a male, took her future
                boss to lunch to outline her transition to a female, as she planned to present herself
                as a female on her first day of the job.
            </blockquote>

                No? I didn't think so.

            </p>
            <p>
                This is an interesting commentary from Dr. Mohler on the shift of women choosing
                to be mothers on their own, typically by artificial insemination. What's missing
                from this picture?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Fathers are missing from this picture, but so is something even more fundamental
                -- God's gift of marriage and the glory of God evident in the perfection of His
                gifts.

                This is a great article detailing how job-seekers can post ads on facebook. What's
                unique about facebook advertising is that you can specify which people groups will
                see your ads (based on school, company, age, interests, whatever). I had never thought
                about advertising in this way.
