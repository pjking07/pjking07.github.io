<a href="/2008/09/two-truths-and-lie.html">Previously</a>, I asked you to pick which statement about myself was a lie.
</p><p>
The response was unanimously correct - I was never a firefighter.
</p><p>
It's true that I lived in 9 unique places over the past 5 years. A summary:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>My parents' home: 1985 - Summer 2003 (Waco, TX)</li>
 <li>Dunn dorm: Fall 2003 (College Station, TX)</li>
 <li>Crocker dorm: Spring 2004 (College Station, TX)</li>
 <li>A rent house: Fall 04 - Spring 05 (Bryan, TX)</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.dtiproperties.com/apt/scandia.html">Scandia Apartments</a>: Fall 05 - Summer 06 (College Station, TX)</li>
 <li>The Arbour House (a rent house): Fall 06 - Spring 07</li>
 <li>My missionary family's house: Summer 2007 (Windhoek, Namibia)</li>
 <li>Walden Court townhomes: Fall 2007 (Norman, OK)</li>
 <li>Our current rent home: Spring 2008 - Present (Oklahoma City, OK)</li>
</ol>
<p>
It's also true that my college chorus (<a href="http://www.singingcadets.com/">The Singing Cadets</a>) sang the Chinese national anthem at the 2003 China-US Relations Conference, including President Bush and Vice Premier Qian Qichen.

Now you know.
