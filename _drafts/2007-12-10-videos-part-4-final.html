<p>Hello Friends
</p><p>
I have been a little preoccupied with my upcoming wedding (Dec. 22nd!) and have not been able to post.
</p><p>
I need to go ahead and finish the Namibia posts so I can post on more recent events (such as the honeymoon) soon.
</p><p>
I taught one of the YWAP students to use free software to make videos like I did. 
One video he made was a tribute to me and Amber (the other girl who stayed with my family that summer).</p>

<p>
Another video he made was for the last YWAP I went to... and thuse was the beginning of his video making...

I think this means I am officially done with Namibia posts. Post wedding details will be coming (relatively) soon!
