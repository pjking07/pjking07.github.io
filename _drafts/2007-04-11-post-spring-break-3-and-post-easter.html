<p>This post is just an excuse to put up photos. </p>

<p>Katie and I forgot to take pictures together during Easter, but we did manage to get a few in over Spring Break (all at the same time). </p>

<p>Here are my favorites... </p>

<p>I'm glad my fiancee loves me - I'm also glad that she's hot. </p>

<p>I went on a book buying spree (bought 9, borrowed 4 from Katie) over Easter for my trip to Africa.</p>

<p>I also ordered a camcorder for the trip as my graduation gift.</p>

<p class="sig">Peace out, 
  <br />Let me know how you're doing, 

  <br />Salutations, 

  <br />Sincerely, 

  <br />Thank you, 

  <br />Get Well, 

  <br />-the awesomeness.</p></div>
