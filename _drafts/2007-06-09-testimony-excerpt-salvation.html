<p><em>As I mentioned previously, I gave my testimony at YWAP last week. Here is an excerpt of the theology I taught to the high schoolers.</em>
</p>

<p>
Now, let me give you a quick theology word lesson. There are three stages of salvation in Christ Jesus: justification, sanctification and glorification.
</p><p>
The first stage of salvation is justification. Justification occurs when you believe by faith that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that by his death and resurrection you are saved from the wrath of God. William Barclay defines justification like this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If God justifies a sinner, … it means that God treats the sinner as if he had not been a sinner at all. Instead of treating him as a criminal to be obliterated, God treats him as a child to be loved. That is what justification means. It means that God reckons us not as his enemies but as his friends, not as bad men deserve, but as good men deserve, not as law-breakers to be punished, but as men and women to be loved. That is the very essence of the gospel.

<p>
That means that to be justified is to enter into a new relationship with God, a relationship of love and confidence and friendship, instead of one of distance and enmity and fear. Justification is the right relationship between God and man. The man who is just is the man who is in this right relationship, and – here is the supreme point – he is in it not because of anything that he has done, but because of what God has done.
</p><p>
The second stage of salvation is sanctification. Sanctification begins at justification and continues until you die, when you become glorified. Sanctification is the continual process of becoming more like Christ, the process of being freed from sins and living a holy life. As long as we are alive, sanctification is not complete. Every born-again Christian is currently in this process of sanctification. The Holy Spirit is teaching you to have the mind of Christ. This instruction can come in the form of a loving sweetness, but it also comes as a loving discipline. This discipline can be painful, but is utterly necessary for your progress in sanctification – for your progress in salvation. In Romans 8:9-17, Paul has some words about Sanctification:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you.
</p><p>
Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation – but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it. For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs – heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.</p>

<p>
That passage leads us right into the next stage of salvation: glorification. Glorification occurs only after we die and are in the glory of the presence of God. Glorification fulfills our sanctification and our salvation. This glorification is what helps us persevere in our sufferings, in our sanctification. By comparing the hard times on Earth with the incomprehensible joy we will have when we are glorified in heaven, we can find purpose in our suffering. Paul continues discussing salvation in Romans 8:18, 24-25 by speaking on the hope we have in our future glorification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us... For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.

<p>
For review, salvation is composed of three stages:</p>  
<ol>
<li>Justification is our belief in Christ</li>
<li>Sanctification is our pursuit of holiness</li>
<li>Glorification is when we are in heaven with our God</li>
</ol>

The Senior YWAPers seemed to follow what I was teaching. The Junior YWAPers (for whom I shortened this to one paragraph) just stared at me blankly.
