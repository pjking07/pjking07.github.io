<p>Today was the first day that we took the Highland team to schools. We also took them to Beautiful Gate. In northern Windhoek, there is a township called Katutura: the slums of the city. Here, many desperately poor and transient people live.
</p><p>
There is a YWAM orphanage in Katutura called Beautiful Gate. This summer, my friend Josh is working there. Josh is two years younger than I, but he has attended Midway, FBC Woodway and Texas A&amp;M with me.
</p><p>
Beautiful Gate (BG) is called an orphanage because all of the kids (under age 6) have lost a parent to HIV / AIDS. BG, however, does not function as you expect an orphanage to – the kids do not live on the campus. BG functions more like a daycare (from 7:30 to 15:30).
</p><p>
The first thing you notice about the children is visual. The clothes they wear are obviously in poor condition and the kids themselves are just dirty. Five year old kids will be running around with dried snot around their noses. This is something I’m used to seeing on toddlers, but not on older children. You immediately can see that you are working with impoverished kids.
</p><p>
What you notice next about the children is olfactory. Most of these kids smell bad. They haven’t been bathed in a while (although BG will bathe them when a child is particularly dirty) and many of them smell of feces.
</p><p>
Next, what you notice about the children is tactile. All that these kids want to do is be held by you. When the team comes in the gates, multiple kids run up to each of them asking to be held. You see, many of these children are not loved at home. Many are abused. They will take love from anyone willing to offer it. The Highland team was great at this – none of the students backed away from the poor, smelly, unloved children. Most of the boys were carrying two kids at a time.
</p><p>
What you notice last about these children – after everything else has hit you – is audible. These children laugh. When we sang with them – they sang along. The kids run around screaming like most kids do in the States. This sensory perception is the hardest on me. It screams at me, saying, that these children are here by circumstance, that it is not their fault they are poor, dirty, smelly orphans. No matter the conditions you find young children – you have to remember that it is not their fault, that they deserve love as much as any other kid.
</p><p>
Sadly, these kids are not the worst off in Katutura. They are the lucky ones. They have a place to go during the day. They have people at Beautiful Gate who love them.
</p><p>
There is a gate to the outside near the playground. On the outside of this gate you will find children begging to enter. These are the kids that should really break your heart. The children at BG have a glimmer of hope for a brighter future with access to the hope that can only be found in Christ Jesus. The children outside the gates, however, may have no such glimmer. They have no one to tell them of Christ’s love – they have no one to model Christ’s love.

Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.

Please pray for the children.
