<p><a href="http://www.jiminhofe.com">Jim Inhofe</a> is the incumbent Republican Senator from Oklahoma.
</p><p>
Typically, voting for him would have been a simple choice. However, the bailout package complicated things for the entire election.
</p><p>
Thankfully, he voted <em>against</em> the $700 billion (+$150 billion more) bailout. Therefore, he gets to <em>keep</em> my vote for this election. (Otherwise, I would have had to look at independent options).
</p><p>
How did your senator vote? Cornyn (R-TX), Hutchison (R-TX), and Coburn (R-OK) all voted in <em>support</em> of the bailout. tsk. tsk.
