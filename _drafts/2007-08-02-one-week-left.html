<p>This is Katie updating for PJ. It's hard to believe, but PJ has just one week left in Namibia! We have a couple of prayer requests to share with you today.
</p><p>
The Woodway team is on their way home. Several of the team members were sick during the trip, and some are still sick as they travel home. Please pray for a smooth trip home for the team and a quick recovery for those who are still sick.
</p><p>
PJ has also gotten sick. Please pray for a fast recovery for him so that he can use his last few days in Namibia well.
</p><p>
Thanks for all your support throughout his trip!
