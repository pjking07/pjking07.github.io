Come home”       <br />And my sins, they watched me leave       <br />And in my heart I so believed       <br />The love you felt for me was mine       <br />The love I’d wished for all this time       <br />And when the doors were closed       <br />I heard no &quot;I told you so&quot;s       <br />I said the words I knew you knew       <br />Oh God, Oh God I needed you       <br />God all this time I needed you, I needed you</p>    <p>And I so hate consequences      <br />And running from you is what my best defense is       <br />I hate these consequences       <br />Because I know that I let you down       <br />Now I don't wanna deal with that</p> </blockquote>  <p class="attr">—Relient K</p></div>
