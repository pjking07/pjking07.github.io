    This weekend was great. I was in Waco for Katie's birthday and my parent's 25th
    anniversary.</p>
<p>
    Katie and I bought each other shirts. We wore them for most of the day (although Katie cheated
    during the first half of the OU/t.u. game). It was really weird looking
    down and seeing Crimson.</p>

    And later that night we went to Diamond Backs with my family.</p>

    It was really good to see her again. Too bad I have to wait til November 5th (4
    weeks) before I have an opportunity to go up to Norman again. And if that fails
    I'll have to wait til Thanksgiving...sigh.</p></div>
