<p>I purchased C.J. Mahaney’s book, <a title="Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581346247/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1581346247&linkCode=as2&tag=pja-20"><em>Sex, Romance, and the Glory of God: What Every Christian Husband Needs to Know</em></a>, from a recommendation Joshua Harris gave in one of his sermons at Covenant Life Church in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Mahaney was the previous Senior Pastor of that church.
</p><p>
I ordered this book online and was surprised to find that it is very short. The first 95 pages of the book are written to the husband and the last 22 pages are written to the wife. The wife section is a chapter written by C.J.’s wife, Carolyn, taken from her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581346158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1581346158&linkCode=as2&tag=pja-20"><em>Feminine Appeal: Seven Virtues of a Godly Wife and Mother</em></a>.
</p><p>
The author's biblical material is based on the Song of Solomon. The rest is from his experience from 30 years of marriage.
</p><p>
The main theme he teaches is “In order for romance to deepen, you must touch the heart and mind of your wife before you touch her body.” This book is no “sex manual” as some may presume. Of the seven chapters, the first five teach on a theology of sex and, essentially, how to woo your woman – and the last chapter is about the covenant love of marriage. Only chapter 6, “The Gift of Marital Intimacy” can really be thought of as a chapter concerning sex directly.
</p><p>
I read this book because I thought it might be useful for me as I prepare myself for marriage. Although the book had some helpful information for someone in my situation, the book’s target audience clearly is a husband who needs to improve his marriage. The book has the intention of immediate application, something I obviously can not do.
</p><p>
Mahaney’s view of sex is summarized in this quote from the first chapter, “Great Sex to the Glory of God”:</p>
<blockquote>It is God’s desire that every Christian couple, including you and your wife, regularly enjoy the best, most intimate, most satisfying sexual relations of which humans are capable. We’re talking really, really good sex. Marital intimacy is God’s gift to those who enter his holy covenant of marriage. And what a gift it is!

</blockquote>
<p>
The author also spends a good amount of time teaching that, yes, God does like married people to have sex, that He wants it to feel good and that sex is both a spiritual and physical experience.
</p><p>
Mahaney offers good advice for the husband who wants to pursue his wife. Some of the points I agree with the most are winning her with your words (written and oral) and having a weekly date night (spending quality time alone with her).
</p><p>
I highly recommend this book to any husband wanting to show more love for his wife.</p></div>
