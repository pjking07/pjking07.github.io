<p>
After we spent the end of my Spring Break in Norman, Katie and I made the trip to Waco, where we stayed all of her Spring Break.
</p><p>
That week was overloaded with Wedding errands, life errands, and Star Wars chores...
</p><p>
Let me explain - for those of you who don't know, I have a substantial Star Wars collection. From 8th grade to my freshman year of college, I was actively collecting (read: purchasing) new Star Wars toys. I ended up investing a large amount of money into my (hopefully) resellable collection. I have 160 unopened action figures which hang on my wall in Waco.

<p>And that only covers 100 of them...
</p><p>
I also have ~30 posters (I love posters), ~10 cardboard stand-ups (which are awesome), and a good number of boxed toys. The boxed toys have been stored in my closet for all these years.

<p>I don't have a picture on this computer of the two shelves at the top of my closet - which are entirely full of Star Wars toy boxes.
</p><p>
I also have a lot of open items that have stayed on my bookshelf.
</p><p>
So what was the chore? Well, my parents are finally making me get all my stuff out of my old bedroom in Waco. Katie and I started the task of cataloging, photologing, and packing all of my stuff. You can only imagine how great of a fiancee I have. I was only able to start the cataloging process with her (we filled seven 14-gallon tubs with boxes from my closet). Thankfully, she is willing to work with my mother to finish the project while I am in Africa.
</p><p>This is what is still in the closet:

<p>
If you consider that the top shelves are now empty, then you would realize that we did a great amount of work. In fact, you can find pictures of the already-boxed items here: boxes <a href="http://tamu.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2285794&l=276d5&amp;id=8304780">A1-A3</a> and<a href="http://tamu.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2285803&l=cc8ef&amp;id=8304780"> A4-A7</a>. Have fun...
</p><p>

Pray for my fiancee and mother as they finish this work while I'm in Africa. Pray they don't go crazy. Pray they don't throw my valuable collection in the trash...
