<p><cite class='bibleref' title='Genesis 22'>Genesis 22</cite> narrates the story of Abraham obeying God by nearly sacrificing his son Isaac. After Abraham’s faith was tested true, the Lord provided Abraham with a ram as a substitutionary sacrifice. This narrative also foreshadows God the Father providing and sacrificing his own Son as a substitutionary sacrifice for all believers.  <p>In v2, God instructs Abraham to sacrifice his beloved son in Moriah (which is Jerusalem, see 2 Chronicles 3:1). Starting in this verse, Abraham is a picture of God the Father, and Isaac is an image of the suffering Christ to come. Verse 4 notes that the journey to Moriah took three days. In biblical literature, three days is most significant as the sign of Jonah, during which the Son of Man was in the “heart of the earth” (and perhaps separated from his father) (Matthew 12:40).  <p>Continuing from v6, the text describes Abraham laying the wood of the sacrifice atop his son, who carried it up the mountain. Similarly, Jesus was given his own sacrificial wood (the cross) to carry up to Calgary. In vv7-8, Abraham and Isaac have a conversation about the missing lamb for the burnt offering wherein Abraham says, “God will provide <em>for himself</em> the lamb for a burnt offering” (v8, ESV, emphasis added). Here, Abraham is not only prophesying that God will provide a sacrifice for them at that time, but also that God himself will provide a future lamb for a greater sacrifice. Following this conversation, Abraham binds his son and lays him atop the wood, just as God the Father would ordain his Son to be hung from a wooden cross.  <p>After preparing his son for sacrifice, Abraham raises his hand to slaughter his son. Throughout this narrative, and including this moment, Abraham is reflecting the future actions and anguishes of God the Father as he sacrifices his own Son. However, this part of the foreshadowing ends in v11 as the angel of the Lord calls for Abraham to not harm his son. The angel continues in v12 to note that Abraham’s faith was being tested, successfully confirming that he feared God and that he was willing to sacrifice his only son. Following this halting of Abraham, the Lord provides a ram for the burnt offering (v13). This ram, now representing Jesus, was offered up in place of Isaac, who now represents mankind. Just as this God-provided ram was sacrificed in lieu of Isaac, Jesus was the God-provided sacrifice in lieu of all believers.  <p>Because Abraham did not withhold his only son, the angel of the Lord declares temporal blessings for Abraham and eternal blessings for the whole world through his offspring (vv15-18). In v17, God promises to multiply his offspring who “shall possess the gate of <em>his</em> enemies” (emphasis mine), singularly referencing one man. It can be assumed then, that v18 continues to refer to this one man (who is Jesus) through whom “shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,” (ESV) which Acts 3:25-26 confirms.  <p>As a prophetic narrative, Genesis 22 has two overlapping meanings: 1) the story of the testing of Abraham by his near sacrifice of Isaac and God’s providing a substitutionary ram on his behalf, and 2) the prophesying and foreshadowing of God the Father providing, through his beloved Son, a future substitutionary sacrifice on behalf of mankind. The significance of this text is not merely to trust God and his promises by having the faith of Abraham, but also to rejoice in God in light of his redemptive story, that from the beginning, God has worked throughout history to provide a perfect substitutionary sacrifice for all who believe.</p> <hr>  <p><em>Writing is a significant component of my seminary education at Southeastern.
