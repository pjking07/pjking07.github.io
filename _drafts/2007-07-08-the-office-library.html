<p>The last time I wrote about Bryan’s office, we had just finished painting it blue. Wednesday, I started organizing the Mission’s books. The office has a lot of cabinets, but no bookshelves. This allowed for great disorganization with the books, particularly because books were stacked on top of themselves.
</p><p>
Soon, we will have bookshelves installed – and my task has been / is to catalog and organize all of the books. This past week, I managed to find all the books in the cabinets (some were hidden quite well) and catalog them on the computer. I piled all the books into the guestroom attached to the office.

<p>As you can see, I tried to have some sort of order to my piling.
</p><p>
Now that I have done that, the next phase will be to categorize the books and decide where to put them. I will have to categorize the physical books as well as the corresponding entries in the computer – which could take a lot of time.

I will also be working on my portion of the YWAP camp video.
