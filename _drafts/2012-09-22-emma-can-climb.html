We discovered today that Emma can (finally) climb out of her crib with ease. In fact, she was so good at it we documented it for posterity.

We have attempted to switch Emma to a toddler bed twice already. First at 18 months and again after she turned 2 years... and she wouldn't have it. We had many nights and naptimes of her causing chaos (and sneaking out of bed late into the night). Both times we brought her crib back, she was relieved. "Yay! My bed." Obviously, we can no longer delay this transition. (and, if she wants to cause chaos at night, she obviously can do that even from a crib now).

We are praying that she will resolve herself to stay in bed. So far, tonight has gone fairly wellâ€”she has not tried to leave her room, but she has filled her bed with <em>lots</em> of toys.
